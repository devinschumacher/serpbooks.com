*Matter and Meaning in an Antiblack World*

<br>

In this groundbreaking work, Zakiyyah Iman Jackson redefines what it means to be human by exploring the intersection of race, gender, and materiality through African diasporic cultural production. Drawing from literature by Toni Morrison, Nalo Hopkinson, Audre Lorde, and Octavia Butler, as well as the art of Wangechi Mutu and Ezrom Legae, "Becoming Human" dismantles the racial logic that has shaped scientific thought since the Enlightenment. Jackson argues that the history of anti-Blackness is crucial to understanding matter, materiality, and posthumanism, offering alternative frameworks of thought that challenge the very foundations of "the human. " This book synthesizes insights from Black critical theory and posthumanism to create a "radically unruly" sense of existence that ruptures traditional boundaries between human and animal, matter and meaning.

*(Re)Writing Undecidable Texts and Bodies*

<br>

Translating Trans Identity explores how translation intersects with sexual and textual undecidability, bridging disciplines through the lens of six bilingual texts labeled as 'trans. ' Emily Rose employs experimental methods, including palimpsest techniques, to examine how these works navigate between languages that encode gender differently. Drawing from philosophy, linguistics, and queer studies, the book reveals how translators and trans authors alike manipulate language to subvert traditional gender categories. This foundational study demonstrates the mutual influence of translation and transgender identity formation, offering scholars in multiple fields a fresh perspective on the act of translation and its role in shaping our understanding of gender identity.
