This graduate-level text continues the study of locally homogeneous affine surfaces, exploring gradient Ricci solitons, Killing vector fields, and geodesic completeness. The authors classify affine surface geometries according to Opozda's scheme, examining left-invariant structures on both the Euclidean plane and the special linear group. A key focus is the quasi-Einstein equation, which connects geometric properties to analytic solutions. The final chapter investigates the neutral signature metric of the modified Riemannian extension on the cotangent bundle, linking surface geometry to higher-dimensional structures.

This posthumous publication presents Prof. Shoshichi Kobayashi's classic work on differential geometry, translated by Eriko Shinozaki Nagumo and Makiko Sumi Tanaka. The book covers five main topics: plane and space curves, local surface theory, Riemannian geometry, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and minimal surfaces. It introduces key concepts like Gaussian and mean curvature, explores the method of moving frames, and discusses the intrinsic properties of surfaces through the first fundamental form. The text provides elegant proofs of fundamental theorems and includes numerous illustrations to aid understanding. While some knowledge of complex analysis is helpful for the final chapter, the book remains accessible to readers with a basic background in mathematics.

*A Mathematical Drama in Five Acts*

<br>

Visual Differential Geometry and Forms by Tristan Needham is a groundbreaking mathematical drama that unfolds in five acts. This work restores geometry to its rightful place in differential geometry through 235 hand-drawn diagrams that illustrate Newton's geometrical methods. The first four acts present four distinct geometrical proofs of the Global Gauss-Bonnet theorem, a simple proof of Gauss's Theorema Egregium, a complete treatment of the Riemann curvature tensor, and an elucidation of Einstein's field equation describing gravity as curved spacetime. The fifth act introduces differential forms in an intuitive manner, covering topics from the unification of integral theorems of vector calculus to the calculation of the Riemann tensor using curvature 2-forms. This book requires only basic calculus and geometry, making advanced mathematical concepts accessible through its unique geometrical approach.
