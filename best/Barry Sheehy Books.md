*The Bahamas during the Civil War*

<br>

When Abraham Lincoln issued his blockade of the Confederate coastline in 1861, it kicked off one of the Civil War's most fascinating chapters. This largely agrarian conflict transformed Nassau, Bahamas, into a smuggling hub where cotton and tobacco flowed between the Confederacy and Britain. As Union ships patrolled the waters, blockade runners devised ingenious ways to slip past them, turning routine supply runs into high-stakes adventures. At the heart of this tale are the complex relationships between U. S. consular officials, the Bahamian governor, and the British merchants who profited handsomely from these illicit trades. "Breaking the Blockade" reveals how this remote island became ground zero for some of the war's most audacious schemes, where every boat that docked could be either friend or foe.

*An Epic Journey from Slavery to Freedom*

<br>

In 1848, a young enslaved couple, Ellen and William Craft, orchestrated one of the most audacious escapes in American history. Disguised as master and slave, they traveled 1,000 miles across Georgia to the free states of the North, navigating by steamboat, carriage, and train while dodging slave traders and military officers. Their daring journey continued for another 1,000 miles throughout New England, where they spoke alongside Frederick Douglass and other abolitionist leaders, generating headlines across the country. However, with the passage of the infamous 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, their perilous adventure entered a new chapter as slave hunters tracked them from Georgia, forcing them to flee not just their captors, but the entire United States. This remarkable true story challenges the nation's foundational principles of life, liberty, and justice, offering an intimate window into a couple's unwavering struggle for freedom amidst the backdrop of international democratic revolt.

*Canada and the Civil War Plots Against Lincoln*

<br>

In this meticulously researched account, Julian Sher reveals the untold story of Canada's complex role in the American Civil War. While the nation proudly served as a haven for 30,000 escaped slaves through the Underground Railroad, its political and business elite simultaneously supported Confederate operations. The book weaves together the journeys of remarkable figures like Anderson Abbott, Canada's first Black doctor who joined the Union Army, and Emma Edmonds, a New Brunswick woman who masqueraded as a man to enlist as a Union nurse. Meanwhile, Confederate agents plotted in the shadows of Toronto and Montreal, where one of Booth's accused accomplices hid out for months with the help of the Catholic Church. As Edward P. Doherty led the hunt for Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth, Sher exposes the dark underbelly of a war that tested the very fabric of North American relations.

*John Yates Beall and the Rebel Raids on the Great Lakes*

<br>

In 1864, the Confederacy launched a audacious campaign from Canada, sending commando units across the undefended northern border to strike at key targets along the Great Lakes. This meticulously researched history reveals the full scope of these clandestine operations, with particular focus on the dramatic but ultimately doomed attempt by Confederate agent John Yates Beall to free 2,700 Southern officers from a prison camp on Lake Erie. As antiwar sentiment grew in the North, these bold raids became a significant threat to Union security and a challenging problem for the Lincoln administration in an election year. Drawing from extensive archival research, this book exposes one of the Civil War's most forgotten chapters, highlighting the Confederate's creative use of geography and the North's unpreparedness for such unconventional warfare.

*Four Smoking Guns*

<br>

In this meticulously researched work, John Fazio presents a compelling case that challenges the long-held belief that John Wilkes Booth acted alone in assassinating Abraham Lincoln. Drawing from groundbreaking research by historians James O. Hall, William A. Tidwell, and David Gaddy, "The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln" reveals four intricate subplots that point to high-level Confederate involvement in the conspiracy. By examining previously overlooked evidence and connecting disparate pieces of history, Fazio demonstrates that Booth was likely a pawn in a much larger scheme orchestrated by Confederate leaders desperate to alter the course of American history. This 241-page volume meticulously analyzes the events leading up to Lincoln's assassination, the trial of Booth's accomplices, and the subsequent cover-up that has shaped centuries of historical interpretation.
