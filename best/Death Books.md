In this profound philosophical work, Samuel Scheffler presents a groundbreaking thought experiment that challenges our conventional understanding of death and the afterlife. He argues that the future existence of humanity matters to us far more than our own personal immortality, demonstrating that the prospect of human extinction poses a greater threat to the values we hold dear than the fear of our own deaths. Through meticulous reasoning and compelling examples, Scheffler shows why the continuation of human life after we're gone is essential for us to lead value-laden lives, and how this realization can transform our approach to mortality and meaning.

When a "Missing" poster catches her eye, Mikita Brottman begins a ten-year investigation into Rey Rivera's death at the Belvedere, a once-grand hotel turned apartment building.

*Maternal Mortality and the Ethics of Care in Tanzania*

<br>

In this compelling ethnography, anthropologist Adrienne E. Strong examines the factors contributing to high maternal mortality rates in a Tanzanian hospital, despite global development efforts. Through detailed observations of everyday care practices, Strong reveals how administrative pressures to document good care actually undermine the quality of care provided, leaving frontline healthcare workers to navigate increasingly complex moral and ethical challenges. The study highlights the broader implications of these findings for understanding healthcare delivery in resource-limited settings and offers valuable insights into the tensions between documentation and actual provision of care in maternal health.

<br>

In this groundbreaking work, philosopher Ingemar Patrick Linden challenges the cultural acceptance of death, arguing for anti-aging science and radical life extension. Linden systematically refutes common arguments in favor of human mortality, from claims that aging is natural to concerns about overpopulation, making the case that death is evil and that we should want more life. Through historical examination of philosophical views on death, from the Buddha to Montaigne, this book presents an optimistic argument for extending human existence, grounded in the belief that the badness of death is a function of life's goodness.
