The Amazon River discharges 57 million gallons of water per second, enough to supply New York City for a year in just two hours. This vast ecosystem, spanning an area the size of the continental U. S. , contains one-quarter of all flowering plant species and hosts the world's largest anteater, armadillo, and spider. Its rainforest absorbs massive amounts of carbon dioxide, playing a crucial role in global climate stability. However, deforestation threatens this delicate balance, with severe impacts already felt in Brazil, Southeast Asia, and the United States. This book presents a comprehensive look at the Amazon's challenges and the dedicated efforts to protect this irreplaceable ecosystem.

*For Democratic Platforms*

<br>

In "The Networked Leviathan, " Paul Gowder argues that democratic institutions offer a solution to the regulatory failures of internet platforms like Facebook, Google, and Amazon. These companies have struggled to prevent fraud, misinformation, and violence among their users, leading to serious societal consequences including election interference and counterfeit medical supplies during pandemics. Gowder demonstrates how the complexity of platform governance exceeds the capabilities of current corporate structures and proposes adapting political science tools to democratize major platforms. Drawing from legal scholarship, this Open Access work shows how democratic mechanisms can enhance regulatory effectiveness while maintaining accountability to both users and society.
