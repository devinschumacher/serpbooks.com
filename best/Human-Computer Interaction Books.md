## [The Semiotic Engineering of Human-computer Interaction](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/The+Semiotic+Engineering+of+Humancomputer+Interaction?i=stripbooks)

![The Semiotic Engineering of Human-computer Interaction | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/0yjnotmvtGkC?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

The Semiotic Engineering of Human-Computer Interaction presents a novel theory that bridges semiotics and computer science to explore the dynamic relationship between designers and users. Clarisse Sieckenius de Souza argues that effective HCI design requires designers to be present in the interface, communicating their vision through a discourse of words, graphics, and behavior. This approach extends beyond traditional user-centered design by treating both designers and users as interlocutors in an ongoing communication process. The book demonstrates how semiotic engineering principles can be applied to various aspects of HCI, including online help systems, customization, and multiuser applications, while also highlighting avenues for future research in this interdisciplinary field.
