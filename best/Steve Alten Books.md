In the depths of the Pacific Ocean's darkest canyon, marine biologist Jonas Taylor encounters the predator of all predators: Carcharodon megalodon, a giant prehistoric shark that dwarfs even the great whites of today. As the sole survivor of a top-secret dive mission, Taylor returns to the surface with evidence of a creature thought extinct for millions of years. When his claims are met with skepticism and labeled as post-traumatic stress, he refuses to back down. It takes an old friend's plea and a daring female submarine pilot to convince him to return to the abyss, where he faces his greatest fear once again. Their descent leads them face-to-face with the true ruler of the deep, a creature that will stop at nothing to protect its domain. As Meg emerges from the shadows, Jonas must choose between his obsession and his survival in this high-stakes thriller that explores the ancient battle between man and monster.
