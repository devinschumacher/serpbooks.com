Under the leadership of Generals Robert E. Lee, J. E. B. Stuart, and Wade Hampton, these scouts developed advanced intelligence-gathering techniques and specialized in "unconventional" warfare tactics. Their effectiveness in numerous close-combat situations earned them begrudging respect from their enemies, establishing their legacy as one of the Civil War's most successful intelligence networks. The book draws from meticulous research to recount the missions and achievements of this Confederate unit that operated deep behind enemy lines.
