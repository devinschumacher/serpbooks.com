In this clever picture book, Karen Kilpatrick and Luis O. Ramos, Jr. tell the story of how Pencil and Eraser became the best of friends. When Pencil draws on the pages of their book, Eraser erases parts of the work, turning their differences into a canvas for creative expression. As they learn to work together, their combined efforts create something even better than what either could do alone. Germán Blanco's engaging illustrations bring this imaginative tale to life, showing young readers the magic that happens when they embrace collaboration and friendship.
