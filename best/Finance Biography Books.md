*America's Original Personal Finance Columnist*

<br>

In 1942, the New York Stock Exchange faced an unprecedented dilemma when it became public knowledge that one of its most respected financial writers, S. F. Porter, was a woman. As the nation's first personal finance columnist, Porter had already carved a unique space for herself in the male-dominated world of finance journalism during the Great Depression. When the NYSE directors voted to award her "honorary pants, " they inadvertently launched a career that would span both professional finance and media innovation. This biography traces Porter's rise from obscure writer to national expert, highlighting the strategies that allowed her to thrive in an almost exclusively male field and establish a genre of newspaper writing that continues to influence financial journalism today.
