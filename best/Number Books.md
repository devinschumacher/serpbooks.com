*The Biology of the Number Instinct*

<br>

In "A Brain for Numbers, " Andreas Nieder explores how our intuitive understanding of mathematics emerges from biological roots. Drawing on brain imaging, behavioral experiments, and twin studies, this MIT Press publication reveals the neurological foundation of numerical competence, tracing it from evolutionary origins to individual development. Nieder examines the specialized "number neurons" that enable mathematical thinking, explaining how symbolic math builds upon innate quantitative abilities. The book clarifies common misconceptions about mathematical genius and discusses the development of dyscalculia, offering insights into how human consciousness constructs mathematical concepts.

On a sunny morning in 2003, a 43-year-old colored man named Magadien Wentzel stepped out of Pollsmoor Prison, leaving behind a life in South Africa's most notorious gang, the 28s. Journalist Jonny Steinberg had spent months interviewing Wentzel about his dual existence: the shadowy world of prison gangs where he was known as JR, and his scattered family in the Cape Town ghettos. What unfolds is a remarkable story of a man trying to reclaim his identity after decades of criminality, set against the backdrop of a changing South Africa. Through their conversations, Steinberg pieces together Wentzel's journey from banditry to bankruptcy, and his ultimate quest to gather his estranged children into a nuclear family. "The Number" is a powerful exploration of memory and identity in a country still grappling with its dark past.
