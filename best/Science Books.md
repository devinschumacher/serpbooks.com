*Rethinking the History of Scientific Naturalism*

<br>

Can scientific explanation ever refer to God or the supernatural? This collection challenges the notion that modern science has always been at odds with religious thinking, examining how past scientists frequently relied on theological ideas in their systematic investigations of the natural world. From ancient Greek naturalists to nineteenth-century thinkers, these essays rethink the history of scientific naturalism and its relationship to religious belief, offering a nuanced perspective on a topic that continues to shape our understanding of science and faith.
