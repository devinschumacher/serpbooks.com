![Why Liberalism Failed | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/AESHDwAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

In this provocative political treatise, Patrick Deneen identifies the inherent contradictions that threaten to unravel liberalism as the last major ideology of the twentieth century. Unlike fascism and communism, which have faded into historical footnotes, liberalism has achieved a precarious dominance by embracing contradictions: it celebrates equal rights while tolerating vast material inequality, derives legitimacy from consent while discouraging civic engagement, and pursues individual autonomy at the expense of social cohesion. Deneen argues that these contradictions are not superficial flaws but fundamental features of a system that may be sowing the seeds of its own demise. Through careful analysis and compelling argumentation, "Why Liberalism Failed" offers both a rigorous critique of contemporary political thought and a clarion call for intellectual honesty in assessing liberalism's true nature and prospects.

This technical book presents an integrated system for forecasting port shipping and ocean environment information, covering everything from tidal level prediction and oil spill early-warning to storm sedimentation theory and monitoring capabilities. The authors, Lin Mu, Lizhe Wang, and Mingwei Wang, draw from multiple disciplines including physical oceanography, meteorology, and environmental science to develop high-performance data processing systems and practical applications at ports like Tianjin and Yangshan. The 238-page volume serves as both a comprehensive reference for engineers and technicians and a valuable resource for students in geoinformatics, port engineering, and marine engineering.
