*Heterosexuality, Child Sacrifice, and the Anglo-Irish Colonial Order*

In this insightful study, Margot Gayle Backus examines how 19th and 20th-century Irish Gothic literature reflects the complexities of Irish colonial history. Through a careful analysis of key literary works, Backus argues that the entwining of capitalism, nuclear family structures, and Protestantism created a cultural framework that both mirrored and influenced the broader historical events of Irish plantation and colonization.
