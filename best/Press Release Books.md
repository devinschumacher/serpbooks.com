*An Analysis of the Metapragmatics of Press Releases*

<br>

In this insightful study, Geert Jacobs examines press releases as a unique genre of institutional discourse. Drawing from a extensive corpus of Dutch and English press releases, the book reveals how these documents anticipate the needs of journalistic writing through specific metapragmatic features. Jacobs analyzes the complex receiver roles in press releases, treating them as indirectly targeted or 'projected' discourse. The book highlights the preformulating functions of self-reference, pseudo-quotation, and explicit semi-performatives in shaping press releases. A case study of Exxon's press response to the 1989 Alaska oil spill demonstrates the practical applications of these linguistic insights. The final chapter discusses the implications of these findings for understanding media hegemony and the broader dynamics of newsmaking and news management processes.
