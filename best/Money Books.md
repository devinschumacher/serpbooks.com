<br>

In this compelling defense of economic liberalism, Benn Steil and Manuel Hinds trace the intellectual history of monetary nationalism from ancient civilizations to the twentieth century. They argue that the modern doctrine of monetary nationalism represents the greatest threat to globalization, exposing the fundamental tension between liberal trade policies and nationalistic monetary systems. Drawing from extensive historical evidence, the authors demonstrate why a universal monetary standard has historically accompanied eras of liberal trade, while periods of economic protectionism have correlated with monetary nationalism. The book warns that the current global trade regime, operating alongside extreme monetary nationalism, is inherently unstable and prone to periodic crises. Steil and Hinds call for a revival of classical liberal economic thinking thatformed the foundation of earlier globalization efforts, highlighting the growing divergence between traditional notions of sovereignty and modern economic realities.

<br>

In this ambitious work, Frederick Kaufman traces the remarkable journey of money from its ancient roots to the complexities of modern finance. Through a masterful blend of historical evidence and allegorical storytelling, "The Money Plot" reveals how currency has evolved from primitive trading rituals to become a powerful tool of economic control. Kaufman examines the ways money has shaped human culture, from the Catholic Church's struggles with commercialism to the 1971 decoupling of the dollar from gold, ultimately showing how financial narratives can either empower or enslave us. This book offers both a captivating history of money and a crucial examination of its role in perpetuating economic inequality, challenging readers to think critically about the financial systems that govern our lives.
