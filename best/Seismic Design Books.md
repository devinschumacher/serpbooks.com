*The Promise: New York*

<br>

In "Sherman: Volume 1 - The Promise, " Jay Sherman - a self-made man who rose from street-level to the upper echelons of society - faces his greatest challenge yet. When his son Robert, a promising Democratic presidential candidate, is shot before his eyes, Sherman's world spins into chaos. As threats escalate against his life and his estranged daughter, an old mentor turned FBI chief offers protection. Yet, with no real leads, their investigation uncovers more questions than answers about Sherman's past - a history that holds more than its share of secrets. This political thriller combines Gatsbyesque elegance with high-stakes drama, marking the first volume in Stephen Desberg's compelling series.
