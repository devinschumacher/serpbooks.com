In this intimate biography of an Indian laboratory, Pankaj Sekhsaria chronicles the innovative work of physicist CV Dharmadhikari and his team at Savitribai Phule University, Pune. Between the late 1980s and 2010, this group designed and built some of India's first scanning tunnelling and scanning force microscopes, pushing the boundaries of contemporary scientific instrumentation. Through qualitative research methods, including open-ended interviews and laboratory ethnography, Sekhsaria examines the social, political, and cultural contexts that shaped this remarkable scientific enterprise, highlighting the often counter-intuitive approaches that led to groundbreaking discoveries.
