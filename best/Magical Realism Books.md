*Magical Realism and the Remystification of Narrative*

<br>

In this comprehensive study, Wendy B. Faris examines magical realism as the most significant trend in contemporary international fiction, analyzing its narrative techniques and proposing a new theory to explain its cultural impact. Drawing from a rich array of examples including works by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Salman Rushdie, and Toni Morrison, the book demonstrates how magical realism destabilizes traditional realism through the organic integration of fantastic elements into ordinary life, effectively bridging the gap between daily experience and the world of spirits. Faris explores the genre's role as a decolonizing force that has empowered marginal voices and submerged traditions to create literary masterpieces, while also addressing criticisms about its potential to commodify cultural differences. The study extends magical realism's principles to issues of gender, highlighting the genre's capacity to replenish realism from within and offering a compelling argument for its significance in modern narrative.

*Magic Realism Seen Through Contemporary Fiction from Britain*

<br>

"Lies that Tell the Truth" challenges the notion that magic realism is confined to postcolonial literature, demonstrating through contemporary British fiction how this literary mode critiques the West's rational-empirical worldview from within.

Hegerfeldt analyzes works by Angela Carter, Salman Rushdie, Jeanette Winterson, Robert Nye, and others to show how magic realism, as a fictional analogue of anthropology and sociology, reveals the complexity of human consciousness and the limitations of empirical knowledge. The book highlights how these magical elements serve a deeper truth about the nature of reality and our attempts to understand it.
