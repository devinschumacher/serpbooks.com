*A Novel*

<br>

In this masterful work of metafiction, Emily M. Danforth weaves a story within a story about a cursed New England boarding school for girls that becomes the inspiration for a modern horror film. The tale begins in 1902 with two young students, Flo and Clara, who form a secret club devoted to a daring writer named Mary MacLane. Their forbidden meetings in an apple orchard lead to a tragic end, setting off a series of mysterious deaths that will haunt the school for generations. Over a century later, a young writer's book about the school's queer history draws celebrity actress Harper Harper to the now-abandoned Brookhants for a film adaptation, where the boundaries between art and reality begin to blur. Through elegant period illustrations and a voice that Entertainment Weekly called "deliciously ghoulish, " Danforth has crafted a novel that combines Sarah Waters' ghostly sensibility with Marisha Pessl's dark imagination and Curtis Sittenfeld's sharp humor.
