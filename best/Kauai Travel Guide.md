*The Separate Kingdom*

<br>

In this meticulously researched history, Edward Joesting chronicles Kauai's evolution from a prehistoric island to its annexation by the United States in 1898. The story begins with Kauai's geological origins and traces its development through the failed conquests of King Kamehameha, the destructive sandalwood and whaling trades, and the rise of sugar cultivation. Joesting's narrative concludes with the fall of the Hawaiian monarchy and Kauai's incorporation into the American territory, supported by previously unpublished historical documents. This illustrated work stands as the definitive account of the island that has long been regarded as the most beautiful in the Hawaiian archipelago.
