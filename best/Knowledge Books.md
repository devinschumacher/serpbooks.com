*Education and the Economics of Growth*

<br>

In this groundbreaking work, economists Eric Hanushek and Ludger Woessmann present a rigorous analysis demonstrating that a nation's cognitive skills, or "knowledge capital, " are the primary driver of long-term economic growth. Drawing from international student assessments and empirical data, the authors argue that traditional proxies for human capital development, such as years of schooling, fail to capture the essential relationship between valued skills and prosperity. Through robust econometric tests and case studies of regional economic phenomena, including the Latin American growth puzzle and the East Asian miracle, Hanushek and Woessmann establish that cognitive skills are the key determinant of a country's development trajectory. The book concludes with policy recommendations for education systems that foster accountability, competition, and performance-based rewards to develop the knowledge capital essential for sustained economic growth.

*Black Women and Educational Activism in Antebellum America*

<br>

In this meticulously researched work, Kabria Baumgartner chronicles the previously unacknowledged efforts of African American girls and women who fought for educational equality in the 19th-century Northeast. Through careful analysis of archival sources and genealogical records, Baumgartner illustrates how these early activists organized, wrote, and protested to desegregate American schools, setting the stage for future generations of civil rights pioneers. Their strategic campaigns led to significant local and state victories, establishing a foundation for the broader school desegregation movement that would reshape American education in the 20th century.
