*BDSM and the Circuits of Sexuality*

<br>

Techniques of Pleasure explores the pansexual BDSM scene in the San Francisco Bay Area through Margot Weiss's ethnographic research. Published by Duke University Press, this work reveals how BDSM practice both relies on and challenges traditional social hierarchies. Weiss demonstrates that while fantasy play within these communities often reinforces existing power dynamics, it also contributes to the commodification of previously unspoken desires. This nuanced study offers readers a closer look at a cultural phenomenon that, contrary to popular belief, is deeply intertwined with broader social and economic shifts.

*The Collision of BDSM, Feminism and Popular Culture*

<br>

When the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy launched a global BDSM phenomenon in 2012, it sparked an academic debate about the genre's intersection with feminism. As public appetite for bondage and discipline, domination and submission surged, scholars questioned whether these trends represented a feminist reversal or a nuanced exploration of power dynamics. Through her own research and experiences in the BDSM community, Catherine Scott examines how pop culture creators from Anne Rice to Scrubs producers have woven these controversial themes into their work, raising important questions about objectification, power, and consent that continue to reshape our understanding of sexual culture.
