When low-rent hustler Eddie gets magically transformed into a pug during a con gone wrong, he never expects to be dragged back into the supernatural world of his former girlfriend's daughter, Tala. As a part-demon herself, Tala finds herself targeted by powerful inter-dimensional forces that threaten to upend not just their lives, but the very fabric of existence. With no other options, she turns to Eddie for help, setting off a chain reaction of chaos that neither of them imagined. Their desperate hunt for a way to reverse the magic threatening to consume them all leads them through a dark fantasy world where nothing - and no one - is quite what they seem.

"Alternative Historiographies of the Digital Humanities" challenges the conventional narrative of humanities computing by examining its evolution through various lenses, including queer gaming, feminist game studies, and indigenous futurities. This collection of essays deconstructs the digital humanities' history as a linear progression from its computational beginnings, instead highlighting the diverse praxis that has shaped the field. By addressing the silences in traditional DH historiography, the book offers a more inclusive perspective on the cultural, environmental, and social dimensions of digital humanities work.

From Dark Horse Comics comes a graphic novel that examines Dr. Fredric Wertham, the controversial psychiatrist who nearly destroyed the comics industry through his misguided crusade against violence.

This Eisner award-winning collaboration between true crime author Harold Schechter and cartoonist Eric Powell presents an unbiased look at a complex man whose noble goals were overshadowed by his zealous methods.
