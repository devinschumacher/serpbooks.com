*How Hymnody Carried Classical Music to America*

<br>

In the decades leading up to the Civil War, most Americans encountered European classical music through hymn tunes, as Peter Mercer-Taylor reveals in this Oxford University Press publication. Editors lifted hundreds of tunes from major composers to set psalms and hymns, creating a distinctive trend in antebellum music-making that helped turn Lowell Mason into America's most influential musician. This study traces the practice's historical rise and fall, highlighting pioneering figures and bestsellers that carried classical music to the American public.

## [Dvorak's Prophecy: And the Vexed Fate of Black Classical Music](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Dvoraks+Prophecy+And+the+Vexed+Fate+of+Black+Classical+Music?i=stripbooks)

<br>

In 1893, Antonín Dvorák arrived in America with bold predictions: he saw a "great and noble school" of American classical music emerging from "negro melodies. " Yet, despite his enthusiasm, Black music would transform popular genres while remaining largely absent from concert halls. Joseph Horowitz investigates this cultural paradox through an ambitious lens, spanning from Frederick Douglass to Ralph Ellison, and challenging the traditional narrative shaped by Aaron Copland and Leonard Bernstein. The book presents a new paradigm that honors previously marginalized Black composers alongside Charles Ives and George Gershwin, offering a more diverse and truthful portrait of American classical music.

In this groundbreaking work, musicologist Lawrence Kramer challenges traditional interpretations of Western art music, arguing for a postmodern approach that considers music as a dynamic cultural practice rather than a static aesthetic object. Drawing from contemporary theories of reason, language, and subjectivity, Kramer demonstrates how classical music can be understood in relation to concrete human experiences rather than abstract principles. Through carefully selected case studies ranging from Haydn and Mendelssohn to Ives and Ravel, this accessible yet informative book offers both nonspecialists and music scholars a fresh perspective on the enduring relevance of classical music in the modern world.
