*A Fashion Iconography*

<br>

Fashion imagery has long been regarded as merely descriptive, but this groundbreaking book reveals its untapped potential as a historical and cultural record. Through an innovative iconographic approach, Sanda Miller decodes three levels of meaning in fashion imagery - from literal depictions to symbolic representations of society and class. Drawing from centuries of fashion illustrations and photographs, this interdisciplinary study demonstrates how clothing choices reflect deeper historical truths about how people lived and presented themselves throughout history.
