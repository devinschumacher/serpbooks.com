<br>

From the mystical streets of New Orleans to the dark alleys of human consciousness, Anne Rice's words have danced on the page like no other author before her. Born into a rich literary heritage and raised in the solemn halls of the Roman Catholic church, Rice discovered her unique voice in 1976 and has since crafted dozens of bestsellers that continue to influence the Gothic genre. Her vampires, with their ornate manners and complex emotions, predated the modern vampire craze by decades, while her non-supernatural works explore the deepest recesses of the human psyche. Through it all, her lush prose weaves a spell as potent as any magic found between the pages of her books. This biography captures the essence of an author who has made the ordinary extraordinary through the sheer power of her writing.
