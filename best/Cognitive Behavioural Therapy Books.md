## [The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT)](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/The+Philosophy+of+CognitiveBehavioural+Therapy+CBT?i=stripbooks)

![The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT) | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/\_x6yDwAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

*Stoic Philosophy as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy*

<br>

In this insightful work, Donald Robertson explores the historical and philosophical foundations of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT), highlighting the striking parallels between ancient Stoic philosophy and modern rational psychotherapy. The book challenges the notion that philosophy and psychotherapy are distinct disciplines, arguing that their convergence offers valuable lessons for both fields. Through a careful examination of Stoic principles and their application in CBT, Robertson demonstrates why modern psychotherapists should embrace philosophical inquiry and why philosophers should engage with psychotherapeutic practice. The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy bridges these disciplines, offering readers a deeper understanding of how ancient wisdom informs contemporary mental health treatment.
