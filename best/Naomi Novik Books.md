*Recovering the Legacy of the Places We've Left Behind*

<br>

In the tradition of Wendell Berry, this lyrical exploration examines the consequences of rural America's most profound loss: the hollowing out of our agricultural heartlands. Through intimate portraits of Emmett, Idaho, and its resilient inhabitants, journalist Grace Olmstead weaves together three generations of her own family's struggles and triumphs amidst thinning communities and punishing farm policies. Part memoir, part investigative report, "Uprooted" challenges readers to consider what we owe the places we've left behind and whether modern life's relentless pursuit of progress might be irreparably uprooting the very foundations of rural America.
