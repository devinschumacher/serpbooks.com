*The Effect of American "Word of Faith" Culture on Contemporary English Evangelical Revivalism*

<br>

In "Importing Faith, " Glyn J. Ackerley examines how American "word of faith" culture has influenced contemporary British evangelical revivalism. Many British charismatics have left mainstream churches for independent charismatic congregations that promise miraculous healings and divine financial provision through faith. However, when these promises go unfulfilled, believers are often told their lack of faith or negative thinking is to blame. Ackerley traces these ideas back to New Thought metaphysics and American pragmatism, showing how British leaders have adopted and adapted these principles through contact with American teachers. The book analyzes several case studies to suggest that while these teachings can be persuasive, their claimed divine origins may have more to do with social and psychological factors than with miracles.
