At the crossroads of modern European and American entertainment, the late 19th century gave birth to musical styles that would forever alter the landscape of popular culture. From the passionate rhythms of flamenco and tango to the emotive melodies of rebetika, these genres emerged as intellectuals sought to redefine the limits of artistic expression.
