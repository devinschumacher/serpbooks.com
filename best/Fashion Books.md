Through detailed examinations of each phase of the queen's life, Weber demonstrates how Marie Antoinette used clothing as a political tool to project power and defy her enemies, ultimately showing how the same fashion sense that secured her early triumphs contributed to her downfall.

## [Clothing and Fashion in Southern History](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Clothing+and+Fashion+in+Southern+History?i=stripbooks)

![Clothing and Fashion in Southern History | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/2QToDwAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

Clothing and Fashion in Southern History examines the complex relationship between textiles and southern culture through a series of essays that challenge traditional fashion studies' focus on high society and archival resources. The collection explores how enslaved people, incarcerated individuals, and the working class experienced clothing as both a practical necessity and a means of personal expression within a global economy that shaped southern fashion from the mid-1800s through the civil rights era. Through diverse case studies, including women's rights to clothing ownership, Confederate women's patriotic sewing, and civil rights-era clothing cooperatives, the volume reveals the deep connections between southern history and the evolving world of fashion.
