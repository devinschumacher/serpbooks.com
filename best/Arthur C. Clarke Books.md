This literary criticism examines Arthur C. Clarke's distinguished career, from his early works to "The Last Theorem. " Highlighting key novels like "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Rendezvous with Rama, " the analysis demonstrates how Clarke's scientific background informed his groundbreaking fiction on space travel, alien encounters, and humanity's future. Contrary to common perception, it argues that Clarke's reserved, solitary characters reflect his profound understanding of human nature and the complexities of scientific progress.

In this Mythopoeic Award-winning novel from Jo Walton, four adults run a comfortable manor house together as happy polygamists, each pursuing their 'lifelode' or purpose: Ferrand lords over the estate, Taveth manages the household, Chayra creates ceramics, and Ranal works the farm. Their idyllic life changes with the arrival of Jankin the scholar and Hanethe, Ferrand's great-grandmother, who returns from the magical East where gods walk and yeya (magic) bends reality. As the seasons change and the harvest comes, their children joyfully explore what their own lifelodes might be in this world where magic and everyday life intertwine.
