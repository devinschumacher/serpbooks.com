*An Erin Kelly Mystery*

<br>

In 1933, as Europe teeters on the brink of World War II, a Bauhaus artist's clandestine actions set the stage for a transatlantic mystery that will unfold decades later. In the 1990s, photographer Erin Kelly and businessman François Rosen, two passionate art enthusiasts, stumble upon a dangerous web of Nazi-confiscated masterpieces hidden within their respective careers. Their personal connection to these artworks draws them into a high-stakes tale of inherited goodness and darkness, where the stakes aren't just artistic but deeply personal. As a ruthless neo-Nazi resurgence threatens to destroy everything they hold dear, these modern-day detectives must untangle the secrets of the past to protect not just the art, but their very lives in this compelling thriller.
