*Perspectives for Research and Teaching*

<br>

This book explores how algebraic concepts were understood and taught in the context of Greek geometry, where the focus was on magnitudes and proportions rather than numerical calculations. It examines the synthetic proofs used in Greek mathematics and the analytical methods that emerged later, showing how geometric traditions influenced algebraic thinking before the 19th century. The authors present three historical proofs of algebraic rules using geometric principles, demonstrating the deep connections between these two branches of mathematics.
