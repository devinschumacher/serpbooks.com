## [Heathenry & The Sea](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Heathenry++The+Sea?i=stripbooks)

![Heathenry & The Sea | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/bZWPzgEACAAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

Since the revival of Heathenry in the second half of the 20th century, much has been written about how the spiritual beliefs held by the people of Northern Europe in the early medieval period can be applied to our lives today. This book explores an aspect of Heathen belief that has not been examined in as much detail up to this point: the relationship between Heathenry and the sea. Drawing on sources from a wide range of disciplines, "Heathenry & The Sea" examines how water featured in the spiritual worldview of our ancestors from the earliest humans through the Heathen period and into the Christianisation of Europe, while also bringing the discussion right up to date with the experiences of modern Heathens and some of the scientific explanations for our intrinsic connections with water.
