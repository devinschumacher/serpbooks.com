*Deciphering Genetic and Social Influences on Adolescent Development*

<br>

This groundbreaking study examines how family relationships and genetic factors shape adolescent development. Over ten years, researchers studied 720 pairs of same-sex siblings and their parents, uncovering specific mechanisms that link genetic influences to complex behaviors through family dynamics. The work reveals that family relationships play a crucial role in expressing genetic influences on development, with different genetic factors associated with mother-child, father-child, and sibling relationships. This "relationship code" offers a new perspective on how genetic potentials are realized through specific family interactions, highlighting the intricate interplay between nature and nurture in shaping human behavior.
