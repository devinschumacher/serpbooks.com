## [Fallen Soldiers:Reshaping the Memory of the World Wars](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Fallen+SoldiersReshaping+the+Memory+of+the+World+Wars?i=stripbooks)

*Reshaping the Memory of the World Wars*

<br>

At the outbreak of World War I, an entire generation of young men charged into battle for what they believed was a glorious cause. Over the next four years, that cause claimed the lives of some 13 million soldiers - more than twice the number killed in all major wars from 1790 to 1914. Yet despite this devastating toll, the memory of the war was not dominated by the grim reality of trench warfare and battlefield carnage. Instead, the war's participants most often remembered its sacredness and the martyrdom of those who had died for the greater glory of their nation. This pioneering work by European historian George L. Mosse analyzes what he calls the "Myth of the War Experience" - a vision of war that masks its horror, consecrates its memory, and ultimately justifies its purpose.

<br>

In "Of War and Law, " David Kennedy explores how legal principles have transformed modern warfare, shaping everything from military strategy to ethical standards for armed conflict. As law has infiltrated the battlespace, it has created new complexities for both humanitarian efforts and military operations, leading to what Kennedy calls the "bureaucratization of strategy. " This legal evolution has not only constrained military action through regulation but has also become a strategic tool in its own right, blurring the lines between legal and military planning. Kennedy warns of the dangers this convergence poses, advocating for a more nuanced understanding of law's role in warfare if we hope to mitigate the horrors of modern conflict.

<br>

In this groundbreaking work, longtime Scientific American writer John Horgan applies the rigors of scientific inquiry to challenge conventional wisdom about war. Drawing from an extensive examination of human and primate behavior, historical conflicts, and cultural studies, Horgan builds a compelling case that war is not an inevitable aspect of human nature, but rather a solvable scientific problem. The book explores how warfare has evolved alongside human civilization, influenced by everything from chimpanzee aggression to the complex social structures of modern nations. Horgan's analysis leads to a provocative conclusion: that peace is just as natural a state for humans as war, and that choosing one over the other is within our biological and cultural capabilities. The End of War synthesizes decades of research across multiple disciplines to offer both a scientific understanding of warfare and hope for a future where peace prevails.

*The Culture of War in Twenty-first-Century America*

<br>

In/Visible War explores the paradox of 21st-century American warfare: while war's impact is omnipresent through media and entertainment, it remains unsettlingly invisible in our daily lives. This cultural disconnect emerges from our consumption of war through the Military-Industrial-Media-Entertainment Network (MIME), which normalizes conflict while distancing us from its human cost. The book examines how this mediated experience of war affects our understanding of its role in shaping our future.
