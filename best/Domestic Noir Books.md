*White Masculinity in Hardboiled Fiction and Film Noir*

<br>

In this carefully selected collection of hardboiled fiction and film noir, M. Abbott traces the evolution of the solitary white male protagonist through the tumultuous period of the Great Depression to the dawn of the Cold War. Drawing from the masterful works of Raymond Chandler and James M. Cain, this study illuminates how these literary icons crafted enduring images of white masculinity in the face of profound societal change. Abbott's insightful analysis extends to Chester Himes's groundbreaking Harlem crime novels, where the traditional tough guy narrative encounters its most formidable challenger yet. The Street Was Mine stands as a rigorous examination of how American popular culture both shaped and reflected the shifting landscape of racial and gender politics in mid-20th century America.

*Film Noir Beyond the City*

Film noir is often associated with the dark and dangerous streets of the city, but this groundbreaking study explores the genre's most iconic works set outside the urban environment. Imogen Sara Smith examines over 100 films spanning from the desolate desert to the eerie borderlands, revealing how these non-urban settings amplify the genre's central themes of isolation and existential dread. Through meticulous analysis of classics like Out of the Past and They Live by Night, the author demonstrates how these films reflect the profound social and physical changes that reshaped America in the postwar years. This work stands as a critical examination of how film noir continues to define the tension between individualism and community in the human experience.

*Reframing Crime and Justice*

<br>

Crime Fiction in the Caribbean: Reframing Crime and Justice explores how contemporary anglophone Caribbean writers are reshaping the crime genre to reflect the region's complex history and societal issues. Through an analysis of works set across Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Guyana, Barbados, Grenada, and Haiti, Lucy Evans examines how these authors use crime fiction as a political and social commentary, highlighting the systemic harms rooted in the Caribbean's colonial past. The book brings together literary criticism with criminological research, offering a scholarly examination of how Caribbean crime fiction challenges traditional notions of crime and justice while addressing pressing social realities like gender-based violence.
