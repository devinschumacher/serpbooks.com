In the summer of 1894, Foreign Minister Mutsu Munemitsu reported to Emperor Meiji that Japan had finally rid itself of the "Unequal Treaties" that had plagued the nation for four decades. These treaties, imposed by Western powers during Japan's period of political division and military weakness, had hindered the country's economic development through discriminatory tariff restrictions, poisoned its foreign relations, and truncated its legal sovereignty through extraterritoriality. This biography examines the final six months of negotiations that led to the revision of these treaties, drawing from Mutsu's personal and official correspondence as well as secret British and Japanese documents.

After Japan's defeat in 1945, she was executed for treason by the Chinese government. This 271-page history presents the most accurate portrait to date of a controversial figure who embodied the complex legacy of the Manchu dynasty in modern Chinese and Japanese history.
