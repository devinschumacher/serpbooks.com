*How Sports Are Sabotaging American Schools*

<br>

In "Sports Crazy: How Sports Are Sabotaging American Schools, " Steven J. Overman exposes the dark side of middle and high school sports, revealing how our sports obsession is harming education. As schools adopt college and professional sports models, they're prioritizing entertainment over academic goals, with parents and fans driving an agenda that undermines physical education and perpetuates gender bias. Overman examines everything from tackle football's dangerous grip on school sports to the distorted relationship between intramural activities and varsity athletics, ultimately proposing radical reforms to phase out interscholastic sports in favor of a more inclusive club model that serves students rather than spectators.
