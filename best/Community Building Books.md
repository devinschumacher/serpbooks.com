In "City Making: Building Communities without Building Walls, " Harvard law professor Gerald Frug presents a groundbreaking legal analysis of how American metropolitan areas have become divided into neighborhoods of privilege and poverty.

Drawing from clear, accessible explanations of legal principles and their real-world impact, the book connects abstract legal concepts to readers' everyday experiences of school choice, neighborhood safety, and civic engagement. Frug offers a visionary alternative legal framework for city-making that would encourage closer links between city dwellers, demonstrating how our understanding of what cities are and what they can achieve must evolve to address today's urban challenges.
