*Plagiarism and College Culture*

<br>

In this insightful examination of academic integrity in the digital age, Susan D. Blum reveals the stark contrast between professors' expectations and students' practices in today's college classrooms. Drawing from extensive student interviews, the book exposes the troubling reality that over 75% of college students admit to cheating, with 68% confessing to plagiarism via the internet. Blum explores how pressures from outcomes-based education, mounting tuition costs, and a culture that prioritizes grades above all else have created an environment where academic dishonesty flourishes. The author presents two distinct cultures existing uneasily side by side: one that views plagiarism as a grave ethical violation, and another that embraces sharing and accomplishment at any cost. While the book acknowledges the complexity of reversing these trends, it offers a crucial starting point for dialogue between professors and students, highlighting the need for clearer communication and aligned expectations in the 21st-century academic landscape.

*Sustaining Indigenous Weapons to Defeat Systemic Monsters*

<br>

Drawing from her Navajo heritage, scholar Amanda Tachine examines the systemic challenges faced by Indigenous college students through an intimate study of ten Navajo youth. As these young people transition from high school to college, Tachine reveals the "monsters" that threaten their educational journey: financial hardships, cultural erasure, and structural barriers that diminish Native presence. Rooted in Navajo knowledge systems, the book weaves together personal stories of struggle and resilience, offering higher education institutions vital insights into creating inclusive environments where Indigenous students can thrive.

*What It Was, Is, and Should Be - Second Edition*

<br>

In this revised edition of his influential work, Andrew Delbanco offers a passionate defense of the traditional four-year college experience, arguing that it remains essential for democratic society. He examines how American colleges have evolved from Puritan gatherings to modern institutions, facing challenges of commercialization and inequality. Delbanco demonstrates why a broadly humanistic education matters in an era of globalization and technological change, and what's at stake for future generations.
