## [On the Persistence of the Japanese History Problem](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/On+the+Persistence+of+the+Japanese+History+Problem?i=stripbooks)

*Historicism and the International Politics of History*

<br>

In Japan, the phrase "that war" often conjures images of both the fifteen-year conflict in the Asia-Pacific and the century-long struggle between East and West that defined much of the 19th century. This dual interpretation underscores a persistent historical problem: the nation's inability to fully confront its imperial past. Hitomi Koyama's "On the Persistence of the Japanese History Problem" explores how this historical ambiguity is intertwined with Japan's shifting role in the global political landscape, offering a nuanced examination of how a postcolonial state grapples with its complex historical legacy.
