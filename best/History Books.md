*Public History and Popular Culture in the 1970s*

<br>

In the 1970s, American culture underwent a profound transformation as the public's relationship to history became increasingly emotional and immersive. This shift was epitomized by the runaway success of historical miniseries like Roots, the advent of living history events, and a resurgence of interest in historical fiction that captured both the feelings and motivations of past generations. M. J. Rymsza-Pawlowska argues that these cultural developments represented a fundamental reevaluation of how Americans understood and interacted with their historical heritage, setting the stage for modern history making.

Through carefully curated examples and practical applications, this innovative book demonstrates why history education must evolve to equip students with the critical thinking skills necessary to navigate our complex, information-rich world.
