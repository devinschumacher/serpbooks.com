*The Barrios of Bogotá*

Public Space in Informal Settlements: The Barrios of Bogotá offers an intimate look at how local communities shape and utilize public spaces within their settlements. Through detailed case studies of Bogotá's barrios, the book reveals the complex interplay between physical environment and social dynamics that defines these neighborhoods. The author, Jaime Hernández-García, draws from extensive field knowledge to challenge conventional views of informal settlements as mere "spare spaces, " instead presenting them as vibrant examples of self-managed urban development. The book will be particularly valuable to architects, urban planners, and researchers interested in understanding the long-term evolution of public spaces within informal settlements and their crucial role in community life.
