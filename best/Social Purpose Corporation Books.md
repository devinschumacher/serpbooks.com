<br>

Modern business corporations have increasingly incorporated social responsibility into their strategic goals, a transformation author Peter J. Buckley examines against the backdrop of evolving regulations and globalization. The monograph traces corporate social responsibility (CSR) from basic compliance to the concepts of "corporate citizenship" and the "responsible corporation." It explores how regulatory frameworks have tightened around businesses and how the notion of earning a "license to operate" through social contributions has given rise to the "purposeful corporation." Buckley's analysis spans three key areas: corporate ownership and control, social responsibility governance, and regulatory changes. The work concludes with research recommendations, emphasizing the strategic advantages that emerge when businesses integrate social objectives.
