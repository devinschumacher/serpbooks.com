*The Story of a Murder*

<br>

In the Sunshine State, a stolen car leads detectives to investigate the disappearance of local motel owner Sabine Musil-Buehler. As three men become persons of interest, the case unfolds on the beaches of Anna Maria Island where author Cutter Wood himself witnessed the search for answers. Beyond the factual evidence, Wood explores the dark undercurrents of relationships that can spiral into tragedy. This true crime narrative, reminiscent of Truman Capote's In Cold Blood, delves into the complexities of love and loss that exist just beyond what can be proven in court.
