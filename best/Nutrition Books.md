Japan's nutritional landscape has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past century, as scientific principles have reshaped the nation's relationship with food.

The "Nutrition Improvement Law" represents a foundational achievement in this journey, illustrating how strategic policy and practice can establish a sustainable framework for healthy eating. This Open Access book, authored by Teiji Nakamura and refined with the assistance of Professor Andrew R. Durkin, serves as both a technical resource for nutrition specialists and an insightful reference for anyone interested in the global impact of nutritional science.
