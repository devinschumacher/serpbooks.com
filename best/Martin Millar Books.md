![Ruby & the Stone Age Diet | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/NzkhAQAAIAAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

In this 172-page gem from 1989, Martin Millar weaves a story about a young man who, at his friend Ruby's insistence, attempts to adopt a "Stone Age diet" - eating only raw grains and fruits in an effort to align with their ancestral nutrition. As the narrator struggles to maintain this challenging diet amidst his lovelorn thoughts for his ex-girlfriend Cis, an intriguing cast of mythological characters emerges: from Helena, goddess of electric guitar players, to Ascanazl, the Inca spirit who watches over lonely souls. Rich with imaginative flair and spiritual insight, "Ruby & the Stone Age Diet" explores themes of friendship, mythology, and the enduring human quest for connection in a world that alternates between raw naturalism and celestial wonder.

<br>

From Augustus to Constantine, this masterful work traces the Roman Empire's expansion across the Near East, forging the provinces of Syria, Judaea, Arabia, and Mesopotamia. Fergus Millar explores the region's rich cultural tapestry, from rabbinic Judaism to early Christianity, against the backdrop of Rome's administrative and military policies. Through rigorous historical analysis, Millar examines the empire's eastern frontier as both a continuation of Graeco-Roman culture and a distinctively oriental entity, synthesizing literary, documentary, and archaeological evidence into a comprehensive narrative of the period's social and religious transformations.

<br>

This philosophical work develops a novel theory of perceptual knowledge that centers on recognitional abilities and perceptually known truths. Rejecting the conventional focus on justified belief, author Alan Millar argues for an epistemological approach that treats perception as the foundation of knowledge rather than a mere pathway to experience. The book explores how we acquire knowledge from perceptual indicators and the role of background presuppositions in shaping our understanding, offering a fresh perspective on the nature of perceptual justification and its place within broader epistemological theory.

*Rebel Songs, Resistance, and Irish Republicanism*

<br>

In the wake of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to decades of conflict in Northern Ireland, loyalist and republican groups sought new ways to preserve their political and cultural identities. Music became a powerful outlet for these communities, as artists and audiences alike turned to song to process the region's complex history of violence and resistance. Drawing from extensive fieldwork and historical research, this book explores how political songs continue to shape Irish Republicanism in the "post-conflict" era, highlighting the genre's role in memorializing the past and informing the present.
