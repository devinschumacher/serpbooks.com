*The Stories We Tell about Poly Lives and the Cultural Production of Inequality*

<br>

In this sociologically informed study, Mimi Schippers introduces "the poly gaze" as a cultural tool to examine how representations of polyamory and poly lives reflect or challenge cultural hegemonies of race, class, gender, and nation. The book explores the role of monogamy in American identity and the ways in which our stories about intimate relationships maintain social inequalities along multiple lines of difference. Drawing from interdisciplinary perspectives, Schippers demonstrates how the introduction of polyamory or consensually non-monogamous relationships in cultural narratives can disrupt dominant meanings of what constitutes a good, American life. This work serves as a key text for understanding debates around heteronormativity and offers an accessible framework for analyzing cultural productions of inequality through the lens of polyamory.

*Attachment, Trauma and Consensual Nonmonogamy*

<br>

Attachment theory has revolutionized our understanding of monogamous relationships, but what about those who thrive on multiple attachments? Psychotherapist Jessica Fern bridges this gap, applying attachment theory to consensual nonmonogamy for the first time. Through her nested model of attachment and trauma, Fern reveals how our emotional experiences shape our ability to form secure connections with more than one partner. Drawing from years of clinical work, she presents six practical strategies to help polyamorous individuals cultivate the deep, fulfilling attachments that mono relationships often take for granted. Part theoretical breakthrough and part practical guide, "Polysecure" expands the conversation around secure attachments to include the complex, rewarding world of nonmonogamy.

Ferrer presents a groundbreaking paradigm shift in romantic relationships, transcending the monogamy-polyamory binary through three pathways: fluidity, hybridity, and transcendence.
