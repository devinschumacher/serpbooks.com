The May 2021 conflict between Israel and Hamas generated worldwide headlines, but much of the reporting failed to address the historical, political, and financial underpinnings of the crisis. This carefully researched account examines Hamas's pattern of initiating conflicts every few years, its use of human shields, and the diversion of aid intended for Gaza's civilian population. Author Jonathan Schanzer traces the terrorist group's connections to state sponsors like Iran, as well as its relationships with Qatar, Turkey, and Malaysia. The 284-page report also explores the efforts of regional powers like Egypt and the UAE to minimize conflict, and it analyzes the implications of the Biden administration's approach to the Iran nuclear deal and "The Squad, " the faction within the Democratic Party seeking to undermine US-Israel relations. This work stands as a comprehensive examination of the factors driving instability in the Middle East and the critical choices facing policymakers.
