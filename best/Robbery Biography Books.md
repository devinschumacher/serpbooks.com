*The Boston Gangsters Who Pulled Off the WorldÕs Greatest Art Heist*

<br>

In 1981, a low-level Boston thief tipped off gangster Ralph Rossetti about the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum's outdated security system, suggesting it was the perfect target for a big score. Nearly a decade later, the museum was hit with one of the most infamous art heists in history: thirteen priceless works by masters like Rembrandt and Vermeer were stolen, kicking off a two-and-a-half decade investigation that's still unsolved today. Through meticulous reporting, Stephen Kurkjian pieces together the events leading up to the 1990 theft, revealing the identities of those behind the scheme and the motive for this audacious crime.
