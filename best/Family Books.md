As the Supreme Court prepares to revisit Roe v. Wade, this general nonfiction title offers an epic look at the people whose lives have been most deeply affected by America's most divisive legal battle.

*Womenâ€™s Century-Long Journey Toward Equity*

<br>

In "Career and Family, " Claudia Goldin presents a comprehensive examination of women's economic progress over the past century, highlighting the persistent gender pay gap and the uneven distribution of domestic labor. Drawing from detailed census data and longitudinal studies of college graduates, Goldin analyzes five generational cohorts of women and their experiences in the workforce, revealing how career trajectories diverge approximately 10-15 years post-graduation. The book argues that traditional work structures have failed to adapt to the increasing participation of women, presenting a compelling case for systemic reforms in both professional and domestic spheres. Goldin's research underscores the need for policies that address the root causes of gender inequality, offering a framework for restructuring home and school systems to support genuine career and family balance.
