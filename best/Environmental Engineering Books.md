*Addressing Grand Challenges*

<br>

The 21st century presents environmental engineers with the opportunity to address humanity's most pressing challenges through technological innovation. A report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine identifies five key areas where the field can make a significant impact: sustainable food, water, and energy production; climate change mitigation and adaptation; pollution prevention and control; resilient urban development; and evidence-based decision making. The report acknowledges the transformative power of environmental engineering's interdisciplinary approach and systems thinking, which have led to advancements in water management, waste reduction, and environmental protection. As global population and development needs continue to grow, the role of these engineers in shaping a sustainable future becomes increasingly important.

<br>

In the Nevada desert, a young woman named Nellie Campbell joins the hunt for a rogue stallion that has been stealing valuable mares from local ranchers. What starts as a simple search for an ordinary horse turns into something far more complicated when Nellie discovers that Rogue Red is no ordinary stallion - but a shape-shifting were-horse with a tragic past. Racing against time across the desert on the red stallion's back, Nellie finds herself torn between her duty to her father and her growing connection to the mysterious man-horse hybrid. Their flight leads them to question everything they've ever known about love, family, and the thin line between human and animal.
