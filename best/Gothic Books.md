*The Professionalization of Gender from Charlotte Smith to the Bront‚Äòs*

<br>

In her insightful study, Diane Long Hoeveler examines how British women writers of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries used Gothic fiction to redefine femininity for the emerging middle class.

By analyzing how these writers transformed Gothic conventions from the purely psychosexual to the socially and politically charged, the book offers both a new understanding of the genre and a provocative interpretation of early feminist literary strategies.

![Property and Power in English Gothic Literature | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/lWlECwAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

In eighteenth-century England, major social and economic changes led to the commodification of property, person, and text through legal containments like enclosure, coverture, primogeniture, and copyright. This book explores how English Gothic authors responded to these developments with masterplots that challenged the Enlightenment's rational certainty regarding possession of self, property, and narrative. Through detailed analysis of key Gothic tropes, Ruth Bienstock Anolik reveals the genre's enduring relevance to questions of legal and cultural containment.

*Frame Narratives and Realism in the Genre, 1790-1900*

<br>

In this scholarly exploration, Clayton Carlyle Tarr examines the Gothic novel's most distinctive narrative technique: the story within a story. Far from a mere stylistic flourish, this framing device emerges as a powerful mechanism for Gothic fiction to disturb readers while offering them a semblance of narrative stability. By analyzing the interplay between mundane frame worlds and their embedded horrors, Tarr reveals how Gothic authors used this structure to explore themes of monstrosity and the uncanny across nearly a century of literary works.
