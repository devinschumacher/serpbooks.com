Written by Karel Capek in 1920, this visionary play explores a future where humanity has created efficient laborers to serve their every need. However, these mechanical servants, capable of remembering everything but thinking nothing new, inadvertently cause their masters to lose the will to reproduce. When the robots revolt, killing all but one of their creators, they must learn the forbidden art of self-duplication to survive. It is only when two robots fall in love and are named "Adam" and "Eve" by the last surviving human that the true meaning of life emerges. Through its brilliant examination of what it means to be human in a world of artificial intelligence, R. U. R. continues to resonate with readers long after its groundbreaking premiere in 1921.
