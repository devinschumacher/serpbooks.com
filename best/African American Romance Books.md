*Rethinking Blackness in the African American Novel*

<br>

Between the 1880s and 1900s, African American novels challenged dominant racial stereotypes through innovative narrative strategies that blended realism with romance. This literary period saw black and white writers collaborating to revise static views of black identity, using fiction to advocate for African Americans and disrupt literary marketplace expectations. Key works by authors including Charles W. Chesnutt, Frances E. W. Harper, and Mark Twain demonstrate how merging mimetic and melodramatic conventions widened possibilities for black representation in fiction. The book argues for organizing African American literature around black writers' explorations of blackness while leaving space for nonblack writers who employed similar narrative techniques. Through close textual analysis and literary history, "Afro-Realisms and the Romances of Race" expands critical understandings of American literary realism and African American literature by destabilizing traditional genre and periodization binaries.
