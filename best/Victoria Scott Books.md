"Remaking Respectability" explores the often-overlooked role of African American women in shaping the cultural and political landscape of interwar Detroit.

As the Great Migration brought tens of thousands of black southerners to Detroit, these women navigated the complexities of class and gender to leave their mark on one of America's most dynamic cities of the 1920s and 1930s.
