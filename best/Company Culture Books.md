*A Practical Guide to Managing Organizational Culture*

<br>

In today's business landscape, organizational culture has become just as important as financial performance. Kirsty Bashforth's "Culture Shift" offers a practical framework for managing cultural change that goes beyond conventional approaches. Drawing from behavioral economics, the book outlines how to align cultural expectations with stakeholder values, implement sustainable habits across the workforce, and measure the impact of cultural initiatives. Bashforth emphasizes the importance of addressing culture change as an ongoing process rather than a one-time project, providing leaders with the tools to maintain cultural momentum within their organizations.
