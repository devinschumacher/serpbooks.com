*Interviews*

<br>

This career-spanning collection brings together sixteen interviews with Tyler Perry, conducted between the early 2000s and 2018. The volume chronicles Perry's journey from struggling playwright to multimedia mogul, highlighting the unconventional approaches that have defined his work. Known for featuring primarily African American actors and infusing his films with Christian themes, Perry has created a diverse body of work that spans drama, comedy, and social commentary. The collection captures critical moments in Perry's career, including the success of his groundbreaking 2005 film "Diary of a Mad Black Woman, " which defied industry skepticism about black church-goers' interest in cinema. Despite controversy over his portrayal of African American characters, Perry's influence extends beyond film, having built one of the largest movie studios in the country and employing more African Americans in the entertainment industry than any other studio. The interviews offer an intimate look at the artist behind the camera, revealing the personal struggles and faith that have shaped his distinctive cinematic voice.

*How Missy Meloney Brought Women Into Politics*

<br>

Born in 1878 to a world where women couldn't vote, Missy Meloney recognized the untapped political power of American women as consumers and family decision-makers. As a journalist and editor-in-chief, she persuaded male publishers and politicians to take women seriously, creating the concept of the female demographic. After the 19th Amendment, she advised presidents from Hoover to FDR on engaging with women voters, leaving an indelible mark on American politics before her death in 1943. This biography restores the remarkable Missy Meloney to her rightful place in history as the queenmaker who brought women into politics.
