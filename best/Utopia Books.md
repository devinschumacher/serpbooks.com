*Introduction by Jenny Mezciems*

<br>

In this groundbreaking work first published in 1516, Sir Thomas More introduces readers to Utopia, an imaginary island nation free from private property, sexual discrimination, violence, and religious intolerance. Through the character of Raphael Hythloday, a philosopher and world traveler, More narrates the customs and social order of the Utopians, whose rational approach to life stands in stark contrast to the political and social turmoil of Renaissance Europe. The dialogue between utopian ideals and European realities invites readers to consider the nature of an ideal society and the challenges of achieving it.

Through careful analysis of previously uncollected ephemera and historical accounts, Miller offers an intimate window into the social and artistic ferment that characterized the first six decades of the century, highlighting the enduring impact of these early communal experiments on American society.

*Steps into Other Worlds*

<br>

After the fall of socialist and communist systems in the East, many declared the "end of utopia. " But in this groundbreaking volume, leading scholars JÃ¶rn RÃ¼sen, Michael Fehr, and Thomas W. Rieger argue that now is the time to rehabilitate utopian thought. Drawing from multiple disciplines including modern cosmology, philosophy, and sociology, these essays expand the narrow political concept of Utopia to encompass the mind's ability to perceive human existence beyond reality. Through comparative studies of Western and Eastern utopian traditions, the authors provide tools for reconstructing scholarly paradigms of utopian, complex, and holistic thinking that can guide us in understanding and shaping our future.

*H. G. Wells, England, and the World State*

<br>

Maxim Shadurski's work investigates how H. G. Wells conceived the World State within the framework of English national discourse, challenging traditional views of place and continuity. The study analyzes Wells's texts alongside contemporary responses from Robert Hugh Benson and Aldous Huxley, examining the intersection of utopian ideas with national identity. Shadurski traces this thematic development through mid-twentieth century literature, considering how authors like George Orwell and J. G. Ballard addressed the conflict between post-national utopia and English cultural identity. The Nationality of Utopia reveals how utopian literature has both challenged and been influenced by nationalistic thinking, while maintain a core humanism throughout these visionary works.

*Plato to Atwood*
