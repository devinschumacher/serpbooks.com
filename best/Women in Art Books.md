In this groundbreaking work, Rozsika Parker and Griselda Pollock challenge the conventional narratives of Art History that have systematically excluded women artists. Through a rigorous feminist critique, they argue that the ideological coding of artistic greatness as 'masculine' has produced a biased canon that requires urgent reevaluation. The authors present expanded readings of historical and contemporary women's art, demonstrating how gender relations shape both artistic production and reception. Their analysis provides key insights into why we study art of the past and how this knowledge informs our understanding of contemporary women's creative work. Published with a new preface by Pollock, this updated edition reinforces the enduring relevance of their original 1981 publication in shaping a more inclusive art historical discourse.

Linda Nochlin's groundbreaking essay, published here in its 50th anniversary edition, refused to answer the question of why there had been no "great women artists" on its own biased terms. Instead, she dismantled the very concept of greatness in art, exposing the white male viewpoint that had dominated art history. Nochlin's work has become a pivotal feminist statement, inspiring generations of artists and scholars to question the institutions that have shaped our understanding of art.
