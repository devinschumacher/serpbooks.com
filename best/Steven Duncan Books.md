![Environmental Ethics in Buddhism | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/nN-oPQ2ZNewC?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

*A Virtues Approach*

<br>

This scholarly work examines the environmental ethics of early Buddhism through a virtues approach. Pragati Sahni analyzes key Buddhist concepts like dhamma, paticcasamuppada, samsara, and the cosmogony of the Agganna Sutta to establish a foundation for Buddhist environmental ethics. The author then illustrates this ethical framework using the Jatakas, a collection of over five hundred folk tales from early Buddhist literature. Through this analysis, the book develops a distinctly Buddhist perspective on environmental ethics that aligns with traditional teachings while offering practical insights into contemporary environmental challenges.

*Cartesian Theism and the Possibility of Knowledge*

<br>

In this philosophical work, Steven M Duncan explores whether Descartes' theistic approach to epistemology can be revived through a synthesis of Platonic and Aristotelian/Thomist elements. The author argues that secular epistemology has failed to establish the possibility of human knowledge more successfully than Descartes' original project, and suggests that a revised theistic epistemology might provide a more robust foundation for understanding the external world.

![How Free Will Works | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/zTJNAwAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

*A Dualist Theory of Human Action*

<br>

How Free Will Works presents a dualist theory of human action that addresses two fundamental philosophical questions: how can non-physical mental acts influence the physical world, and how can free choice exist without being causally determined or random? Steven M. Duncan develops a novel conception of mind-body interaction that resolves the traditional "interaction problem" while preserving the autonomy of free will. The theory is then applied to Christian doctrines of salvation, offering insights into how sin, grace, and redemption can be reconciled with human freedom.

![Facing Reality | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/5f0hvgAACAAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

*A Challenge to Physicalism*

<br>

In this metaphysical treatise, Steven Merle Duncan challenges the fundamental assumptions of contemporary analytic metaphysics, particularly the prevailing doctrine of Galilean Physicalism. He argues that this scientific worldview, which reduces all existence to elemental particles and their interactions, fails to account for the richness and diversity of the physical world we experience. Through rigorous philosophical analysis, Duncan clears the conceptual ground for a return to traditional realism, advocating for an Aristotelian ontology that acknowledges the existence of material things and their intrinsic properties.

*An Alternative to Physicalism*

<br>

This philosophical study challenges the widespread belief among analytic metaphysicians that ordinary material objects do not exist, tracing the origins of this radical claim to a commitment to Galilean Physicalism. Through rigorous examination, Steven M. Duncan defends common sense ontology, demonstrating why we should embrace an worldview that acknowledges the reality of material things like trees, houses, and human bodies. His work stands as a significant contribution to the ongoing debate between physicalist and commonsense approaches to metaphysics.

<br>

This philosophical monograph defends the traditional Aristotelian account of causality while critiquing various forms of determinism that have been thought to be inconsistent with genuine free will. Steven M. Duncan examines mechanism, fatalism, and predestinarianism, demonstrating how these deterministic views fail to align with our intuitive understanding of cause and effect. Through rigorous analysis, the book reveals the limitations of deterministic thinking and provides a robust framework for understanding causality that preserves the possibility of meaningful free will.

<br>

The concept of being stands as the most fundamental notion in both philosophy and metaphysics, serving as the essential starting point for any investigation into the nature of reality. This contemporary analysis explores why understanding being is crucial for philosophical inquiry and how it forms the basis of all scientific knowledge about the true nature of things. Through careful examination of the philosophical ideas surrounding being, the book offers readers valuable insights into the science of being qua being and its significance for our understanding of existence.
