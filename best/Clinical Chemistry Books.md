<br>

The Feynman Lectures on Gravitation document Richard Feynman's pivotal contributions to gravitational physics during the 1962-63 academic year at Caltech. Spanning 169 pages, these lectures present his revolutionary, quantum-mechanical approach to general relativity, examining gravity's central role in cosmology, superstars, wormholes, and gravitational waves. Feynman develops a self-consistent theory of a massless spin-2 field (the graviton) interacting with matter's energy-momentum tensor, emphasizing the connection between gauge invariance and the principle of equivalence. This collection preserves Feynman's groundbreaking insights into gravity's quantum nature and its implications for our understanding of the universe.

<br>

This meticulously researched history traces the evolution of clinical chemistry from its origins in the seventeenth century to its establishment as a distinct scientific discipline at the beginning of the twentieth century. Louis Rosenfeld examines how clinical chemistry developed alongside organic chemistry, physiology, and biochemistry, reconstructing the often obscure path that led to its current state of clinical importance. Through detailed chronology and careful analysis of primary sources, this volume preserves the story of a scientific field that has fundamentally transformed our understanding of health and disease.
