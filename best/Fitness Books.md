*Health, Fitness, Sport, and American Society*

<br>

In this meticulously researched social history, Harvey Green examines how nineteenth-century America's diverse medical philosophies emerged from a potent mix of religious fervor, frontier daring, and scientific ignorance. As doctors trained in just six weeks prescribed heroic dosing, botanic remedies, and homeopathic cures, their unregulated practices reflected a nation torn between spiritual healing and scientific progress. Through clear writing and astute analysis, Green reveals the enduring impact of these early medical beliefs on American health attitudes, offering both fascinating historical insights and relevant lessons for contemporary medicine.
