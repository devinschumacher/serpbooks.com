*Recovering the Roots of Landscape Architecture*

<br>

In "The Culture of Cultivation, " Raffaella Fabiani Giannetto proposes a groundbreaking shift in landscape architecture that moves beyond traditional binary oppositions to embrace a holistic, cross-disciplinary approach. Drawing from the profession's agricultural roots, this illustrated collection challenges current practices that prioritize urban growth at the expense of the rural, instead advocating for design solutions that integrate food systems, soil conservation, and cultural landscape preservation. The book demonstrates how expanding the expertise of landscape architects to include productive farming practices can lead to more sustainable land management and biodiversity conservation, offering practical frameworks for professional practice and academic research in the 21st century.
