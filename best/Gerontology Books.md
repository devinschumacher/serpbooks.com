*Gerontologists and Their Biosocial Visions, 1900-1960*

<br>

Between 1870 and 1940, life expectancy in the United States more than doubled, transforming aging from a rare phenomenon to a pressing social issue. As seniors began living longer and retiring earlier, the Great Depression exposed the vulnerabilities of an unprepared society, where medical and public health advancements had outpaced social support systems. This historical gap between scientific progress and social policy created an urgent need for a new field of study that could address the complexities of aging. "Old Age, New Science" examines how a pioneering group of American and British scientists responded to this challenge, developing gerontology as a multidisciplinary field that would revolutionize our understanding of aging and its impact on society.

*Why and How We Age*

<br>

Evolutionary Gerontology and Geriatrics explores the groundbreaking possibility of modifying or canceling the aging process, challenging the notion that aging is an uncontrollable degenerative phenomenon. The authors, leading experts in evolutionary medicine, dissect the cellular and organismal mechanisms of aging and present actionable strategies for intervention. Through rigorous scientific evidence and within the framework of evolutionary medicine, this multidisciplinary work demonstrates why aging is not an inevitable decline but a physiological process that can be controlled, offering hope for a future where aging is no longer considered a medical failure.
