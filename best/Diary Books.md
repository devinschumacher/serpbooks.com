In this daring novel published serially in the Yiddish daily newspaper di Varhayt from 1916-18, Miriam Karpilove offers an intimate window into the sexual and political awakening of a young Jewish woman in early 20th century New York City. Through lyrical and humorous first-person entries, the protagonist navigates the treacherous waters of radical youth culture, where her every move is met with judgment from both progressive friends who pressure her for sexual freedom and traditional landladies who demand respectability. The diary captures raw struggles with consent, body autonomy, and women's empowerment in a time when these concepts were just beginning to take shape, making it a crucial document of Jewish-American feminist thought at its nascent stage.
