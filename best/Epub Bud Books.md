## [Bud Wilkinson and the Rise of Oklahoma Football](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Bud+Wilkinson+and+the+Rise+of+Oklahoma+Football?i=stripbooks)

![Bud Wilkinson and the Rise of Oklahoma Football | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/bFkmEAAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

At the end of World War II, the University of Oklahoma football team was far from the elite programs that dominate college football today. But in 1947, a visionary coach named Bud Wilkinson was hired to lead the team, and over the next 16 years, he transformed Oklahoma football from mediocrity to national prominence. This meticulously researched biography chronicles Wilkinson's coaching career, revealing the innovative strategies and leadership tactics that earned him widespread acclaim in the football community. Through detailed accounts of the team's legendary 47-game winning streak and thrilling matchups against Notre Dame, Army, and USC, author John Scott highlights the most significant moments of Wilkinson's tenure. The book also explores the coach's landmark decision to integrate OU athletics and the dramatic food-poisoning incident that nearly derailed the 1959 season. Drawing from extensive interviews with Wilkinson, former OU president George L. Cross, and numerous former players, this work stands as the definitive account of Oklahoma football's rise to dominance under its greatest coach.
