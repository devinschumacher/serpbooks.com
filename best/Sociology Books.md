Since the 1950s, sociology has faced a decline in academic prestige and institutional support, with some universities retrenching or downsizing their sociology departments. This collection of sixteen essays examines the discipline's most pressing problems and offers diverse perspectives on potential solutions. The essays highlight several recurring themes: sociology's growing ideological bias, low levels of academic consensus, failure to address significant social issues, and inadequate integration of post-modernist theories. The collection raises fundamental questions about sociology's relationship to empirical evidence and its model of human behavior, challenging readers to consider whether the discipline can maintain its relevance in contemporary social science.
