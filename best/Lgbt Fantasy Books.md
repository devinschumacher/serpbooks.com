Richard St. Vier, the legendary swordsman, navigates a landscape of dangerous alliances and deadly rivalries, where a single duel can alter the balance of power.

"Swordspoint" stands as a brilliant fusion of high fantasy and sharp social commentary, elevated by Kushner's elegant world-building and George R. R. Martin's praise as "an unforgettable opening that just gets better from there. "
