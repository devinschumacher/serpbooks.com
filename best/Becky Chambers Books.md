As human beings gain the ability to explore neighboring exoplanets, a young explorer named Ariadne chronicles her remarkable journey across four habitable worlds fifteen light-years from home. Her mission becomes not just one of scientific discovery, but a poignant tale of humanity's reach into the unknown and the sacrifices made for knowledge.
