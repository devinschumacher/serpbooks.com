*Why Marketing is (Still) Sexist and How to Fix It*

<br>

In their groundbreaking work, Jane Cunningham and Philippa Roberts expose the pervasive gender bias that continues to shape marketing strategies, despite industry claims of embracing feminism. Drawing from extensive research, the authors document how marketing efforts consistently fail to represent women authentically, instead opting for simplistic "fempowerment" slogans that do little to address real gender issues. The book critiques the industry's misguided attempts to redefine women's roles through marketing, highlighting the significant disconnect between these efforts and the lived experiences of women. Ultimately, Cunningham and Roberts present a innovative framework for marketing that promises to be more inclusive and representative of women's diverse experiences.
