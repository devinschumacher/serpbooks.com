*Women and the “Re-Privatization” of Labor*

<br>

In "Feminist Theory in Pursuit of the Public, " R. Goodman argues that feminism must develop a robust theory of the public sphere. The book responds to a critical moment when feminist efforts to redefine the private sphere left a significant gap in political thinking about the public. This theoretical void becomes particularly problematic as nation-states and their publics face diminishing power and compromised democratic agency. Goodman explores how the weakening of public institutions affects citizens' ability to shape the conditions of life, suggesting that without a strong public sphere, the progress toward gender equality and social justice will be severely limited.

*Contesting the Core Concepts of Feminist Theory*

<br>

"Fundamental Feminism" by Judith Grant delves into the theoretical pillars of feminist thought that have defined modern feminism. Through rigorous examination of the concepts "woman, " "experience, " and "personal politics, " the book charts their development from the women's liberation movement to the present day, revealing the limitations of these foundational ideas. Grant analyzes how these theoretical frameworks have shaped major feminist debates, including the predominance of white female viewpoints, the friction between anti-pornography and pro-sex feminists, and the impact of postmodernism. The author argues for a comprehensive reevaluation of these core concepts to address unresolved issues in feminist theory and to enhance feminist political efficacy.

*A Decolonial Perspective*

<br>

In this groundbreaking work, Françoise Vergès presents a feminist theory of violence that centers on decolonial perspectives. Drawing from interdisciplinary research, the book argues that state institutions often fail to protect marginalized communities from gender violence. Vergès demonstrates why anti-racist and decolonial approaches are essential for developing effective violence prevention strategies that address the root causes of gender-based violence. The State will not protect us from gender violence offers a comprehensive framework for understanding and combating violence against women, highlighting the importance of intersectionality in crafting inclusive safety policies.

*Visions of Subjectivity in Feminist Theory*

<br>

"The Man Question" by Kathy E. Ferguson reimagines feminist theory through a courageous examination of masculinity. Rather than reinforcing the traditional "woman question," this work challenges conventional gender binaries and provides a sophisticated analysis of male dominance and female subordination. Ferguson's groundbreaking approach simultaneously constructs and deconstructs a women's perspective, ultimately advocating for a more nuanced understanding of how gender shapes our lives and experiences.
