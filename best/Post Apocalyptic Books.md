From historical thinking to the practices of literacy itself, these carefully selected novels use the conventions of post-apocalyptic genre fiction to challenge and redefine the pillars of modernity in the face of 21st-century challenges.

Decades after economic and environmental collapse, the Coast Road region has rebuilt itself on the ruins of the past, developing a society where households must earn the right to bear children through symbolic banners of privilege. As Enid delves into the case of an outcast's suspicious death, she uncovers cracks in her carefully constructed world that force her to question everything she stands for.
