*A Genealogical Journey*

<br>

When a young cowkeeper and his wife arrive in London, England, in the 1840s, they hope to escape poverty by walking from coastal Wales with their cattle. Instead, they and their descendants become entangled in the dark underbelly of Victorian and Edwardian London, where tragedy, war, and economic collapse await. Through meticulous research and personal storytelling, Kristen den Hartog and Tracy Kasaboski trace their family's harrowing journey from the slums of London to a new life in Canada, offering an intimate window into a turbulent period of history that few have documented from this perspective.

*Algorithms, Approximation, Optimization*

<br>

This rigorous second volume of a four-part series covers the essential mathematical foundations of algorithms, approximation, and optimization. It integrates probability theory, Fourier series, wavelet analysis, and dynamic optimization into a unified framework that bridges theoretical mathematics with practical applications in data science and machine learning. The 806-page textbook is designed for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students, offering a mathematically precise treatment of topics that are crucial for modern applied and computational mathematics. Through carefully structured exercises and examples, it builds a deep understanding of algorithm analysis, approximation techniques, and optimization methods, supported by free supplemental lab materials that demonstrate the practical relevance of these mathematical concepts.
