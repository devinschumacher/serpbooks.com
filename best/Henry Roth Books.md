The story unfolds across four chronologically linked volumes, capturing Ira's transformation from a boy swimming in "a sea of glory" to an elderly man haunted by the sins of his youth. As Roth weaves together themes of sexual deviance, family drama, and the relentless march of modernity, he creates a profound narrative about memory and human consciousness that spans from the outbreak of World War I to the Roaring 20s. Through Ira's intimate relationship with his computer, Ecclesias, Roth crafts a counterpoint between youth and old age that gives this 1312-page epic its remarkable power and resonance.
