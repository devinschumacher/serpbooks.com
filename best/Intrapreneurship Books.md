## [Intrapreneurship and Trust](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Intrapreneurship+and+Trust?i=stripbooks)

<br>

Trust and entrepreneurship are vital for long-term economic prosperity, but their relationship is often misunderstood due to a focus on independent entrepreneurship that overlooks intrapreneurship within established organizations. This book explores how generalized trust facilitates intrapreneurship through mechanisms that reduce the need for complete contracts and influence the size of the welfare state, making employment more attractive than self-employment for entrepreneurial individuals. Using a unique dataset from 2011 to 2017, the authors Niklas Elert, Erik Stam, and Mikael Stenkula provide empirical evidence supporting these hypotheses across multiple countries.
