*Love and Art on Formentera*

In this innovative travelogue, a midlife Canadian couple trades the rigors of backpacking for the creative freedom of a Formentera cottage. As Noella sketches in watercolor and Wilson pushes the boundaries of postmodern fiction, their personal and artistic ambitions intertwine amidst the island's wild beauty. Will their refuge become a crucible of despair or a canvas for new intimacy? "Red Rock Road, Light Blue Sea" weaves together love and art in a narrative that spans from Canada to the Mediterranean.
