<i>How Raising Children Is Changing Across America</i>

<p>Parenting in America has undergone a profound transformation over the past decades, evolving from a traditional family duty to a complex social phenomenon driven by class, economic instability, and technological change. This scholarly examination reveals how the modern concept of "parenting" emerged in the 1970s, coinciding with broader shifts in family structure and function.

Through careful analysis of socialization processes, author Nancy A. McDermott provides valuable insights for students, parents, and policymakers navigating the complexities of contemporary American parenting. </p>
