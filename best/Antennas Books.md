This technical report investigates the radiation patterns produced by combining linear and slot antennas. The author develops theoretical models for the far-field radiation of a dipole antenna positioned between two slot antennas, calculating the effects of various relative phasings between the elements. The report demonstrates how this antenna configuration can approximate an isotropic radiation pattern when the dipole is oriented perpendicularly to the slot plane. To validate the theoretical predictions, the author fabricates an experimental antenna and measures its radiation characteristics, achieving good agreement with the theoretical formulas. The 64-page report provides detailed insights into the design and performance of combined linear and slot antenna systems.

"Wide-Range Antennas" by Boris Levin presents innovative methods for analyzing and synthesizing antennas that significantly expand their frequency range. The book demonstrates how concentrated capacitive loads connected along linear and V-antennas achieve superior matching with cables over wide frequency bands while enhancing directional characteristics. Levin introduces two groundbreaking theoretical approaches: a method for calculating directional characteristics of radiators with given current distribution and an electrostatic analogy technique for computing fields in complex multi-element structures. These methods optimize performance for director-type and log-periodic antennas, enabling broader frequency coverage and reduced size. The book explores various antenna configurations, including flat and three-dimensional self-complementary designs, and compares their properties with traditional conical and parabolic structures. It also covers advances in transparent antennas, cellular communication solutions, and multi-tier designs, making it an invaluable resource for antenna engineers and researchers seeking to push the boundaries of wireless communication technology.
