*Leisure and the Culture of Work in America*

<br>

From mid-nineteenth century America through the 1950s, this cultural history examines how leisure activities have mirrored and magnified the values of the workplace. Steven Gelber argues that hobbies, far from being mere distractions, have systematically brought utilitarianism and social stratification into the home, reinforcing traditional gender roles and economic hierarchies. Through theoretical analysis and historical evidence, "Hobbies" reveals the complex ways in which Americans have constructed meaning in their leisure time, reflecting broader cultural shifts towards rationalization and specialization.
