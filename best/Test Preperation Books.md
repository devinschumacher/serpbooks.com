*Charles Fort and the Evolution of the Genre*

<br>

Charles Fort, a pioneering researcher from the early 20th century, collected reports of unexplained phenomena that would later become staples of science fiction. His work influenced renowned authors like Arthur C. Clarke and H. P. Lovecraft, who saw the science-fictional potential in Fort's catalog of mysteries and anomalies. This literary criticism examines how Fort's ideas about UFOs, cryptids, and unexplained natural phenomena shaped the genre and continue to inspire writers today.
