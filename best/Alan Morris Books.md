*Writers and 'la Mode Rétro' in Post-Gaullist France*

<br>

In this carefully selected chapter from his broader study on post-Gaullist French literature, Alan Morris examines Patrick Modiano's seminal work "La Place de l'Étoile" (1968). The novel centers on Raphael Schlemilovitch, a character who embodies antisemitic stereotypes from the Vichy period, providing a chilling window into the persistence of anti-Jewish sentiment in French society. Through this lens, Morris illuminates Modiano's place within the "retro" literary movement of the late 1960s and 1970s, a movement characterized by its critical reevaluation of France's mythic Resistance narrative. The chapter offers both a nuanced portrait of Modiano's literary techniques and a provocative look at how French writers grappled with their country's traumatic past in the decades following World War II.
