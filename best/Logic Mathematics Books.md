<br>

At the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and philosophy, mathematical logic examines the power and limitations of formal mathematical thinking. This expanded edition introduces readers to the basics of model theory, proof theory, and computability theory, leading to rigorous proofs of Gödel's First and Second Incompleteness Theorems. The text also features a new introduction to incompleteness through computability and solutions to selected exercises, making it suitable for both classroom use and self-study.
