<br>

Video game culture has reached a crossroads, with scholars divided between narratology and ludology, and an overemphasis on violence, sexism, and addiction dominating the discourse. This collection brings together international researchers from rhetoric to computer science to explore the medium's true potential beyond these reductive themes. The essays examine digital game theory, ludic spaces and temporalities, and video game rhetorics, emphasizing that games should be understood on their own terms rather than through borrowed academic frameworks. The contributors argue for a more nuanced approach that recognizes the medium's power as a tool for education and change, challenging the notion that games are either harmless children's entertainment or invidious mass media. Through original research and theoretical frameworks, this volume aims to redirect Game Studies toward a more productive exploration of digital games' cultural significance.
