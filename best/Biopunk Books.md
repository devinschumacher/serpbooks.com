*Solving Biotech's Biggest Problems in Kitchens and Garages*

<br>

In this visionary work, Marcus Wohlsen introduces us to a movement of DIY scientists who are rewriting the rules of biotechnology. These "biohackers" are bringing the tools of genetic engineering out of the laboratory and into kitchens and garages, where they're developing everything from cancer drugs to food safety solutions. As Bill Gates has said, hacking biology is the frontier of innovation, and Wohlsen shows us how this grassroots movement could lead to some of the most significant scientific breakthroughs of our time.

*Solving Biotech's Biggest Problems in Kitchens and Garages*

<br>

In this visionary work, technology journalist Marcus Wohlsen introduces us to a new breed of hackers who are turning genetic code into Lego-like building blocks for life. Operating in kitchens and garages rather than corporate labs, these "biohackers" are democratizing DNA much like the Internet did for information. Wohlsen chronicles a movement that spans from cancer drug companies started in kitchens to open-source DNA copying machines, highlighting the potential of citizen science to address everything from global health to environmental protection. As Bill Gates has noted, the future of world-changing innovation may well reside in the hands of these brilliant outsiders who are rewriting the rules of biotechnology with nothing but laptops and lab equipment.

In a Nigeria transformed by science fiction, Tade Thompson introduces us to Rosewater: a town that sprang up around the edge of a mysterious alien biodome. Here, government agent Kaaro returns to confront his dark past and uncover the truth behind a series of eerie killings. As he delves deeper, Kaaro faces revelations about a terrifying future that threatens to upend everything he thought he knew. "Rosewater" is the award-winning first novel in Thompson's Wormwood Trilogy, bringing together elements of Jeff Vandermeer, N. K. Jemisin, and Ann Leckie in a tale that's as much about the human condition as it is about aliens and biodomes.

*Literary and Visual Imagination in the Age of Biotechnology*

<br>

"Biofictions" by Lejla Kucukalic introduces three innovative concepts - biofiction, bioimagination, and biodiscourse - to explore the intersection of literature, visual arts, and biotechnology. Through two critical approaches, the book draws parallels between genetic codes and human language, examining how biological and literary narratives converge in the age of biotechnology. This interdisciplinary study analyzes a diverse corpus of works, from David Foster Wallace's "Infinite Jest" to the TV series "Altered Carbon, " arguing that the practice of altering genetic codes is itself a form of discursive storytelling that exists at the organic-literary interface.
