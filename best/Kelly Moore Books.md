*Social Movements, American Scientists, and the Politics of the Military, 1945-1975*

<br>

In the decades following World War II, American scientists found themselves at the center of a significant cultural shift. Celebrated for their contributions to social and technological progress, these scientists also faced widespread criticism for their increasingly close ties to military and governmental power. This tension gave rise to a unique phenomenon: scientist-led protest organizations that sought to democratize science and make its pursuit more transparent. Drawing from extensive archival research and interviews, Kelly Moore examines how these organizations, including Science for the People and the Union of Concerned Scientists, challenged the established scientific community's relationship with political and military institutions. The book reveals how American scientists, recognizing the environmental and social implications of their work, transformed their own professional culture to prioritize transparency and ethical responsibility.
