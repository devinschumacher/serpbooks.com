*Popular Blues in America, 1850-1920*

<br>

Before Mamie Smith's groundbreaking 1920 blues recording, over 450 other blues titles had already appeared in sheet music and on recordings - a rich musical heritage that Peter C. Muir documents in this scholarly examination of early popular blues. Focusing on the genre's formative years between 1850 and 1920, Muir explores the intricate relationship between folk and popular blues, revealing how these musical styles influenced each other and evolved together. The book highlights W. C. Handy's pivotal role in both blues music and the music business, offering a detailed look at the sheet music and print sources that shaped the genre's early development. Through careful analysis of this previously unexamined material, Muir provides a revised understanding of blues evolution and its significance to mainstream American culture in the early twentieth century.
