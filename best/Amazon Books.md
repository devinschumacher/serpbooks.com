In the summer of 1948, as Russia blockaded Berlin and the Western Allies responded with a massive airlift, a young American pilot named Gail Halvorsen began an extraordinary experiment in kindness that would transform wartime enemies into friends. Starting with just two sticks of gum shared with some Berlin children watching planes land, Halvorsen's "candy drops" grew into a global phenomenon, touching millions of hearts and proving that even in the darkest hours of history, simple acts of generosity can ignite something beautiful between nations.
