<br>

Call Admission Control (CAC) and Dynamic Channel Assignment (DCA) are critical decision-making problems in mobile cellular networks that traditionally have been treated as separate issues, despite their interdependence. This book presents an integrated approach to CAC that considers DCA as a core component of the decision-making process, addressing the limitations of current methods that fail to account for mobile station movement and network load fluctuations. The authors formulate CAC as an optimization problem aimed at minimizing call drops while considering channel availability, cell hotness, and mobile station dynamics, demonstrating superior performance to traditional techniques through the use of evolutionary algorithms and fuzzy comparators.
