*A New Origin Story*

<br>

The 1619 Project: A New Origin Story dramatically expands on the groundbreaking 2019 New York Times Magazine issue that reframed American history by placing slavery and its legacy at the center of our national narrative. This comprehensive collection presents eighteen essays that examine how the institutions and individuals that shaped the United States were profoundly influenced by the country's original sin of chattel slavery. Through thirty-six works of poetry and fiction, the book illustrates key moments of oppression, struggle, and resistance that have defined African American experiences from 1619 to the present day. The project synthesizes contributions from leading scholars, artists, and thinkers to offer an unflinching look at how the legacy of slavery continues to shape every aspect of American life, from politics and music to traffic and citizenship. This work stands as a vital update to our understanding of American history, contextualizing the systems of race and caste that continue to impact our nation.
