<br>

In this profound philosophical work, Jean-Luc Nancy explores the nature of sleep, challenging traditional views that dismiss it as mere bodily repose or source of unconscious signs. Through rigorous yet poetic analysis, he examines what it means to "fall" asleep, uncovering a modality of being that exists beyond waking consciousness. Nancy contends that sleep reveals an equality of all existence within the rhythms of the world, offering neither familiar meaning nor religious comfort, but instead glimpses into the infinite nature of meaning itself. This unique phenomenological study stands as a significant contribution to understanding the relationship between consciousness and its limits.

In 1899, two African-American brothers from a Virginia tobacco farm were kidnapped and thrust into the circus, where they performed outrageous stunts for sold-out crowds at Madison Square Garden and Buckingham Palace.

Meanwhile, their mother waged a 28-year quest to bring her sons home, forcing readers to grapple with a painful question at the heart of American history and race relations.
