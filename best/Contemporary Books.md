## [Environmental Justice in Contemporary US Narratives](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Environmental+Justice+in+Contemporary+US+Narratives?i=stripbooks)

![Environmental Justice in Contemporary US Narratives | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/bC4dDgAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

This scholarly examination traces how American literature has grappled with environmental justice from the Dust Bowl to the turn of the 21st century. Through close readings of works by John Steinbeck, Ruth Ozeki, and Cherríe Moraga, among others, Yanoula Athanassakis demonstrates how these authors have used their platform to highlight the intricate connections between ecological degradation and social inequality. The book argues that by representing the human body as vulnerable to environmental risks, these narratives offer both a cautionary tale and a call to action, inviting readers to consider their own role in shaping a more just and sustainable future.
