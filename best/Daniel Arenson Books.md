In the mid-19th century, St. Louis stood at the crossroads of North, South, and West, making it the ideal setting for a group of influential citizens who sought to unite these divergent regions. Their ambitious plans to transform St. Louis into a cultural, commercial, and national capital were tested during the contentious debates over slavery, emancipation, and Manifest Destiny that ultimately led to the Civil War. While conventional wisdom portrays the war as a straightforward conflict between North and South, this meticulously researched book reveals the critical role of Westerners in shaping the nation's future, highlighting the often-overlooked cultural and political significance of the American West in the events leading up to and during the Civil War.

<br>

Reason, the cognitive scientists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber argue, evolved not to help us solve abstract problems but to facilitate cooperation and communication within social groups. This groundbreaking book explains why human reasoning, despite its apparent flaws, is actually remarkably well-suited to our collaborative nature, and why similar cognitive abilities didn't evolve in other animals. Through compelling discussions of how reason helps us justify beliefs, convince others, and evaluate arguments, "The Enigma of Reason" offers both provocative insights and practical understanding of what makes human thinking unique.
