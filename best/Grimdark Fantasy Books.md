When a starship explosion strands a group of survivors on an inhospitable alien planet, their desperate bid for colonization sets off a high-stakes tale of survival and resistance.

In this elegant and electric tour-de-force, Hugo and Nebula Award-winning author Joanna Russ weaves a 157-page parable about the perils of forced conformity and the timeless struggle for individual rights in the face of extinction.
