*What America Owes to Blacks*

<br>

In this powerful and controversial book, distinguished African-American political leader Randall Robinson argues that both white and black Americans owe a significant debt to the rich history that slavery and segregation severed. Drawing from extensive research and personal experience, "The Debt" calls for comprehensive reparations that extend beyond monetary compensation to include educational programs and social initiatives that address the legacy of racial discrimination. Robinson maintains that only by reclaiming their lost past and proud heritage can African Americans lay the foundation for their future, while white Americans must actively work towards creating equal opportunities for all citizens. This compelling indictment of past wrongs also serves as an urgent call to educate Americans about the history of Africa and its people, offering a candid roadmap for bridging the divides that still haunt our nation.
