*Peter van de Kamp and the Vanishing Exoplanets around Barnard's Star*

<br>

Astronomer Peter van de Kamp claimed in 1963 to have discovered a planet around Barnard's Star, sparking a decades-long scientific debate. Using meticulous observations from Swarthmore College's observatory, van de Kamp detected what he believed were planetary "wobbles" in the star's path. His findings, which received widespread attention including a television appearance with "Mr. Wizard, " couldn't be replicated by other researchers. Van de Kamp retired in 1972, leaving behind a legacy that would only be fully understood with the exoplanet boom of the 21st century. This MIT Press book chronicles his ambitious search and the scientific community's response, highlighting the challenges of early exoplanet detection and the eventual confirmation of a different planet around Barnard's Star in 2018.
