## [Ilongot Headhunting, 1883-1974](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Ilongot+Headhunting+18831974?i=stripbooks)

![Ilongot Headhunting, 1883-1974 | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/J9EXAOx-qYAC?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

*A Study in Society and History*

<br>

Renato Rosaldo's seminal study, informed by 34 years of research among the Ilongot people of Northern Luzon, presents headhunting as a cultural practice that underwent dramatic transformation between 1883 and 1974. By synthesizing oral histories with written records, this work challenges the anthropological assumption that "primitive" societies exist in a static present, instead documenting the practice's evolution from inter-tribal conflict to targeted raids against Japanese soldiers and lowland Christian Filipinos before its eventual decline. Through detailed analysis of structure, events, time, and consciousness, the study reveals the complexity of small-scale, non-literate local communities and the limitations of traditional anthropological methods in capturing their nuanced history.
