In the spring of 1917, as the United States prepares to enter World War I, three sisters from New Jersey leave their farm to join a groundbreaking military-style training camp for women. When an accident forces the youngest sister, Constance, to take over as camp commander, she faces skepticism from the War Department and a scornful public. With their tent-mate, the mysterious Beulah Binford, hiding a scandalous past under a false identity, these pioneering women must prove themselves in a world that doubts their capabilities. As military discipline clashes with their independent spirits, the Kopp sisters discover that serving their country comes with very real dangers and unexpected challenges.
