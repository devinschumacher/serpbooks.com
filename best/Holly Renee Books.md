*Living with Loss*

<br>

A trusted grief expert shares her profound insights on navigating the complex emotions that follow the loss of a loved one. Marisa R. Lee's elegant prose invites readers to embrace their grief as an integral part of their journey, offering practical wisdom on how to honor the legacy of those they've lost. Through her own experiences with multiple losses, including the recent pandemic, Lee reveals the essential elements of healing: permission, care, feeling, and grace. She explores how Black people, especially women, uniquely process grief and why traditional "stages" often fall short of capturing the messy reality of loss. Lee's transformative approach helps readers understand that healing doesn't mean moving on, but rather learning to love the person who's gone with the same depth and commitment that defined their relationship in life.
