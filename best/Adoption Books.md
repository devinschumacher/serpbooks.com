*Secrecy and Disclosure in the History of Adoption*

Through careful analysis of historical evidence, this book provides valuable insights into the evolution of adoption in the United States and the enduring impact of secrecy versus disclosure on our understanding of family.

*Social Revolution and Political Aesthetics in Contemporary Chile*

Beginning in October 2019, Chile experienced a wave of protests that transformed civil disobedience into a widespread resistance movement. As the political landscape shifted, street walls became canvases for expression, with murals and graffiti capturing the spirit of the moment. This illustrated book documents the artistic explosion that occurred in Chilean cities during this period of social and political upheaval, reflecting on the movement's global context and the lasting influence of Chile's authoritarian past. Through their observations and analyses, authors Terri Gordon-Zolov and Eric Zolov provide both a visual catalog of the street walls that came to life during this time and a thoughtful examination of the artistic traditions that informed them.
