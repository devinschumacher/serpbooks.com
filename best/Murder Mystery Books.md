## [Theory of Prose](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Theory+of+Prose?i=stripbooks)

![Theory of Prose | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/CI31iJEmuYoC?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

Viktor Shklovsky's groundbreaking 1925 work, Theory of Prose, stands as a seminal contribution to literary criticism that anticipates the major theoretical movements of the 20th century. This meticulously translated volume explores how writers structure their material according to artistic principles rather than attempting to mimic "reality, " offering readers a profoundly influential framework for understanding fiction. Through close readings of works by Cervantes, Tolstoy, Sterne, Dickens, Bely, and Rozanov, Shklovsky develops a sophisticated theory of prose that challenges conventional notions of literary representation. Originally suppressed by Soviet authorities in the 1930s and unavailable in English until now, this collection of essays poses fundamental questions about the nature of fiction that remain as relevant today as they were in the 1920s.
