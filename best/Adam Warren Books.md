## [Medicine and Politics in Colonial Peru](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Medicine+and+Politics+in+Colonial+Peru?i=stripbooks)

![Medicine and Politics in Colonial Peru | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/YxJVfWBcs5YC?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

*Population Growth and the Bourbon Reforms*

<br>

By the end of the eighteenth century, Peru had experienced the decline of its silver industry and suffered massive population losses due to smallpox and other diseases. As economic salvation depended on increasing the labor force and maintaining healthy workers, the Bourbon reforms provided an opportunity for local elites to transform society through medical advancements. Creole physicians seized this chance to establish secular medical practices, treating smallpox and leprosy while reforming medical education and funeral rites. However, after independence, government officials reversed these reforms, returning medical care to the church and leaving Creole doctors without imperial support. This 304-page study demonstrates how, despite political fluctuations, Bourbon reforms and creole physicians laid the foundation for modern medicine in Peru, an influence that continues to shape the country's medical landscape today.

*The Postmortem Cesarean Operation in the Spanish Empire*

<br>

In 1786, Guatemalan priest Pedro José de Arrese published a groundbreaking work instructing readers on the proper technique for performing cesarean operations on recently deceased pregnant women to extract viable fetuses. This critical practice, aimed at cleansing unborn children of original sin, circulated widely throughout the Spanish Empire, with local variations emerging in Mexico, Peru, and the Philippines. Drawing from archival cases and contemporary print culture, this Penn State Press volume presents Arrese's complete treatise alongside works by Spanish surgeon Jaime Alcalá y Martínez, Mexican physician Ignacio Segura, and Peruvian friar Francisco González Laguna. The book demonstrates how this controversial procedure became a significant intersection of medical advancement and religious duty in colonial Latin American history.
