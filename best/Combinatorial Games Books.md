*Desirability Relations, Trading, Pseudoweightings*

<br>

Simple games, mathematical structures inspired by voting systems, are explored in this Princeton University Press publication as a coherent subfield of finite combinatorics. The authors, Alan D. Taylor and William S. Zwicker, blend new theorems with results from threshold logic to examine these games' properties, particularly their weightedness and robustness under player trades. The book serves as both an introductory text, emphasizing Boolean subgames and the Rudin-Keisler order, and an advanced study on the wide array of properties related to game weightedness.
