<br>

In the 1930s, as the threat of war loomed, Germany took the lead in aviation technology with the development of the world's first flight-worthy turbojet engine by Dr. Hans von Ohain. Installed in a Heinkel-designed aircraft, this groundbreaking engine ushered in the jet age on August 27, 1939, giving Germany a significant advantage throughout the war. While British engineer Frank Whittle independently developed a similar engine that powered the Gloster Pioneer in 1941, and the United States began its own jet programs in 1942, neither country could match Germany's progress until after the war's end. Pavelec's "The Jet Race and the Second World War" chronicles this high-stakes competition and its impact on both military and civilian aviation.
