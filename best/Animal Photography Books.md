*Local Governments and Immigrant Incorporation*

While national politics around immigration become increasingly polarized, local governments across the United States have developed innovative ways to welcome and integrate immigrant populations since the 1990s.

The author explores whether these localized efforts will continue in the face of changing federal immigration enforcement and rising anti-immigrant sentiment.
