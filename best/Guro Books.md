*The Mass Culture of Japanese Modern Times*

Silverberg's innovative use of montage theory illuminates the ways in which Japanese subjects "code-switched" between competing cultural and political narratives, crafting a rich tapestry of everyday life in interwar Japan that will undoubtedly become a cornerstone of Japan scholarship.

*Jakobson’s Theory and Praxis*

Roman Jakobson's semiotic theory of poetic analysis combines linguistics, structuralism, and urban poetics in this groundbreaking study by Mary Coghill. Published by Walter de Gruyter, the book develops Jakobson's theories of communication and poetic function through formalist methods, with particular attention to women narrators and Charles Sanders Peirce's influence. Coghill proposes a city poetic genre that reveals the structural and semiotic patterns within poems, offering an experimental praxis for the poetry of our urban future.
