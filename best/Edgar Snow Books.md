In 1936, a young Edgar Snow Venture into the unknown territories of China, armed with nothing but a letter of introduction to Mao Tse-tung, the enigmatic Chairman of the Soviet Government. Navigating through a landscape of conflicting reports and rumors about the Chinese Red Army - described variously as a mass of hungry brigands and a disciplined revolutionary force - Snow finds himself in the midst of a struggle that challenges everything he thought he knew about Communism. What unfolds is a personal odyssey through a China that exists in stark contrast to the Western understanding of the Communist movement, where Lenin's works go unread and the fight for an independent China takes precedence over international revolution.
