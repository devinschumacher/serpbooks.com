## [The Politics of Secularism in International Relations](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/The+Politics+of+Secularism+in+International+Relations?i=stripbooks)

<br>

In this groundbreaking work, Elizabeth Shakman Hurd challenges the conventional wisdom that religion has been relegated to the private sphere in the West. Drawing from the philosophical and historical foundations of secularism, she examines how this political framework shapes international relations, particularly in the context of U. S. -Iran and EU-Turkey relations. By presenting secularism as a form of political authority, Hurd reveals the socially and historically constructed nature of the secularist divide between religion and politics, offering a nuanced alternative to realist, liberal, and constructivist approaches in the field of international relations.

![Foreign Policy and Congress | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/FpZFDwAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

*An International Relations Perspective*

<br>

"Foreign Policy and Congress" examines how international events shape domestic politics, challenging the conventional view that the President alone drives U. S. foreign policy. Through an analysis of Senate roll call votes from 1897 to 1984, Marie T. Henehan demonstrates that congressional behavior varies systematically in response to critical foreign policy issues. The book reveals a pattern where international developments spark increased congressional activity, followed by periods of relative passivity once policy debates reach resolution. This work offers political scientists and policymakers a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between international relations and American foreign policy making.

![Hierarchy in International Relations | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/o\_utDwAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

In this groundbreaking work, David A. Lake challenges the conventional wisdom that international relations exist in a Hobbesian state of nature, where countries interact without any superior authority. Drawing from historical and contemporary evidence, Lake demonstrates that states actually form social contracts creating hierarchies that vary over time but remain a fundamental aspect of the international system. These hierarchies, particularly those led by the United States, significantly influence foreign policies, international cooperation, and patterns of conflict. By revisiting core concepts of authority and sovereignty, the book offers a nuanced understanding of political order in the modern international system and explores the implications of America's declining legitimacy following the Iraq War.

*The Realist Theory of International Relations and Its Judgment of Human Nature*

<br>

What Moves Man challenges the realist theory of international relations by critically examining its underlying assumptions about human nature. Freyberg-Inan argues that realist psychology is fundamentally incomplete, suffering from a pessimistic bias that distorts our understanding of what drives human behavior in the international arena. Through a detailed analysis, the book reveals the limitations of realist thought and suggests a more nuanced approach to studying international relations that accounts for the full complexity of human motivation and action.

<br>

In this carefully curated collection of essays, prominent scholars Christine Ingebritsen, Iver Neumann, and Sieglinde Gsthl explore how smaller nations punch above their weight in international relations. The volume examines the unique strategies these states employ to challenge conventional power dynamics, from leveraging tightly knit domestic institutions to serving as "norm entrepreneurs" in global governance structures. Through case studies ranging from sustainable development to humanitarian policy, the essays demonstrate why realist approaches often fail to predict the impactful roles small states play on the world stage.

*Diplomacy, Discord and International Relations*

<br>

Based on newly accessible Turkish archival documents, this political science study examines the deteriorating diplomatic relations between Turkey and the Soviet Union during World War II. Author Onur Isci details how historical Russophobia in Turkish elite circles, combined with Soviet territorial ambitions and German investments in the Ottoman Empire, led to a breakdown in bilateral relations. The book argues that this period marked a significant reversal of AtatÃ¼rk-era policies, driving Turkey towards NATO rather than maintaining neutrality.
