In "Black Politics in New Deal Atlanta, " Karen Ferguson examines how the Roosevelt administration's social welfare programs transformed the lives of college-educated African Americans in the segregated South. Working within federal agencies as social workers and administrators, these black reformers saw an opportunity to prepare their community for full citizenship while building a constituency for future civil rights activism. However, their efforts to enforce bourgeois behavioral standards created new divisions within the black community, stratifying it between those deemed worthy of federal support and those left behind in the struggle for racial equality.

*Urban Neighborhoods and the End of Progress toward Racial Equality*

<br>

In "Stuck in Place, " Patrick Sharkey argues that political decisions and social policies have led to severe disinvestment from black neighborhoods, creating a multigenerational cycle of inequality that cannot be explained by individual circumstances alone. Drawing from decades of data, this urban policy study demonstrates how racial gaps in income and test scores are intimately tied to the neighborhoods where families have lived for generations. Sharkey calls for transformative urban policies that address the systemic disinvestment and segregation that have persisted since the 1970s, offering a compelling case for why traditional approaches to neighborhood improvement have fallen short.
