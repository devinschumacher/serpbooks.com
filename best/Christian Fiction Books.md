*When Congressional Leaders Fail*

<br>

The Politics of Herding Cats investigates the impact of media coverage on congressional leadership and public policy. By examining Washington Post coverage over four decades, John Lovett demonstrates that while congressional leaders usually determine policy outcomes, increased media attention empowers other members to influence legislation, often causing policy shifts that contradict leader preferences. The book analyzes this dynamic through case studies on agricultural subsidies, immigration, and healthcare, showing that only under extraordinary circumstances, such as with the Affordable Care Act, can leaders maintain control in the face of heightened media scrutiny and growing stakeholder involvement. This work provides valuable insights into the evolving relationship between media and Congress, and how individual lawmakers can challenge party leadership on major issues.
