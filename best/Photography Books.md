In this thoughtful examination of contemporary photography, David Levi Strauss challenges the notion that "seeing is believing" in an age of digital manipulation and immediate image access. He explores how photographic images have evolved from trusted documents to questionable representations, threatening our connection to visual truth. Through careful analysis of photography's impact on public opinion and personal belief, Strauss highlights the growing tension between technical images and the reality they're supposed to represent. His work serves as a crucial inquiry into how we've come to believe in images and what that belief means for our understanding of truth in the digital era.

![Forget Photography | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/LQgWEAAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

In this provocative work, Andrew Dewdney argues that photography's cultural influence persists even as the medium undergoes technological obsolescence. Published by MIT Press in 2021, the book examines how photographic thinking shapes our understanding of reality, and why we need to "forget photography" to comprehend the image in the age of algorithms and data flow. Through theoretical analysis and cultural critique, Dewdney develops a systematic approach to reveal the limitations of photographic thinking and its impact on visual culture. The book challenges readers to consider the future of the image beyond photography's historic framework, offering insights into the evolving relationship between technology, representation, and cultural memory.
