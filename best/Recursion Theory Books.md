*An Introduction to Recursive Function Theory*

<br>

What can computers do in principle? What are their inherent theoretical limitations? This book develops the theoretical framework that enables such questions to be answered, starting from the idea of a computable function - a function whose values can be calculated in an automatic way. Over the course of 268 pages, it builds up the concepts and techniques needed to understand the capabilities and limitations of recursive function theory, providing a rigorous foundation for the study of computation and its philosophical implications.
