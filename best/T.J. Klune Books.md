*New Perspectives on Differential Argument Marking*

<br>

Differential argument marking, a linguistic phenomenon observed across multiple language families, has been the subject of extensive research due to its implications for grammar and language processing. This volume brings together leading linguists to explore theoretical questions surrounding differential case marking, examining its manifestations in Indo-European, Sinitic, Turkic, and Uralic languages. The chapters collectively address the adequacy of existing theoretical models in explaining various forms of differential marking, including those influenced by topicality, cumulative factors, and double marking. The volume serves as both an introduction to the current state of research in this field and a comprehensive examination of the theoretical issues it raises.
