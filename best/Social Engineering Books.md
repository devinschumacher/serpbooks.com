<br>

In this insightful work, Christopher S. Kayser explores how social engineering has evolved into the backbone of modern cybercrime. Drawing from real-world experiences and his extensive background in computer programming, Kayser develops the RESCAT theory to explain why people fall victim to cyberattacks and discusses practical measures to enhance digital security. The book also examines the broader impact of technology on society, questioning whether early adoption interferes with cognitive development and offering valuable perspectives on cybercrime prevention education.
