*Expressivist Foundations of International Criminal Justice*

<br>

International criminal justice has long been recognized as a "spectacle of didactic legality, " yet its expressive and communicative functions remain underexplored in legal scholarship and practice. This groundbreaking work by Professor Carsten Stahn redresses this gap by developing an expressivist foundation for international criminal justice that spans norm diffusion, institutional actions, legal procedures, and harm repair. Drawing from the sociology of law and punishment theory, the book demonstrates how expression and communication are integral to the punitive functions of international criminal justice and offers a systematic framework for understanding legal practice beyond traditional justifications of justice and punishment.
