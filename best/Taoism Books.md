*A Comparative Study of Key Philosophical Concepts*

In this groundbreaking work, Toshihiko Izutsu compares the metaphysical and mystical thought-systems of Sufism and Taoism, revealing striking parallels between these historically unrelated traditions. Through rigorous analysis of key concepts from Ibn 'Arabi, Lao-tzu, and Chuang-tzu, Izutsu identifies common ontological frameworks centered on the Absolute Man and the Perfect Man. This comprehensive study demonstrates how fundamental patterns of mystical and metaphysical thought can emerge independently in diverse cultural contexts, offering philosophers and mystical thinkers alike a rich comparative framework.

*Taoism, Ch’an, and Original Zen*

The book examines fundamental Ch'an concepts including meditation, mind, and awakening through Hinton's precise translations, emphasizing the tradition's ecological dimension and its goal of integrating individual consciousness with the living cosmos. Hinton compares standard translations to reveal how the original understanding of Ch'an/Zen was altered during its transmission from China to the West, offering readers a chance to deepen their connection with both themselves and the world.
