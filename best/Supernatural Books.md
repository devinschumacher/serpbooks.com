In this scholarly examination of supernatural short fiction from the Americas, Dana Del George traces the genre's evolution alongside shifting cultural and scientific perceptions of the supernatural over the past two centuries.

Through these explorations, the volume celebrates the resilience of premodern indigenous spiritual traditions in the face of scientific materialism and demonstrates how short fiction has served as a dynamic arena for negotiating competing worldviews in the Western Hemisphere.

*Reactions to the Supernatural in Works by the Master of Horror*

<br>

In "Surviving Stephen King: Reactions to the Supernatural in Works by the Master of Horror, " literary critic Rebecca Frost examines how King's human characters confront and respond to supernatural threats. Analyzing over 30 of King's works, Frost identifies four primary approaches characters use to explain and deal with the supernatural: cultural appropriation, Christian rites, outright destruction, and resigned acceptance. The study reveals that no single approach guarantees success against King's supernatural antagonists, with outcomes varying dramatically across different stories. Frost argues that the most effective response occurs when characters choose actions aligned with their true selves, offering readers insights into the complexities of belief and the human condition within King's literary universe.
