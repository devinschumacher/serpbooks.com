*The Story of the USA's Majority Minority*

<br>

Latino and Hispanic History: The Story of the USA's Majority Minority traces the rich and complex heritage of Latin Americans in the United States, from Spain's early colonization efforts to the present day. Through a practical Q&A format, author Michael Noricks examines the key historical events, influential figures, and cultural milestones that have shaped the Latino and Hispanic experience in the U. S. The book highlights the community's explosive growth, from a small colonial presence to becoming the nation's majority minority in 2003, and explores the diverse regional differences between Caribbean, Central, and South American influences. Noricks also delves into the aftermath of Mexico's territorial cessions to the U. S. , which accounts for 65% of today's Latino population, and analyzes the demographic shifts that predict one-third of Americans will be Latino or Hispanic by 2050. This work stands as an essential resource on the topic, bridging the gap between academic history and accessible public knowledge about the Latin American contribution to the United States.

*A Deep State Run Amok*

<br>

In this meticulously documented exposé, Pedro Israel Orta pulls back the curtain on a deeply flawed Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) that has been systematically perverted for political gain. Drawing from his own experiences within the CIA and IC, Orta reveals how this critical safeguard for national security whistleblowers has been twisted to target a sitting president while genuine whistleblowers face unprecedented retaliation and abandonment. The narrative builds to a climax around the "Ukraine whistleblower" case, where Orta's investigative prowess uncovers a meticulously orchestrated political storm that threatens to consume everything in its path. Through 616 pages of unflinching revelations, "The Broken Whistle" stands as a powerful indictment of a bureaucratic state that has chosen to crush dissent rather than uphold the truth.
