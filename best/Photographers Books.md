*Euro-American Women Photographers and Native North Americans, 1880-1940*

<br>

Trading Gazes examines the photographic work of four Euro-American women who documented their interactions with Native North Americans from 1880 to 1940. Unlike the male-dominated archive that often portrayed American Indians as vanishing or domesticated, these women's images offer fresh perspectives on the era's colonial expansion and indigenous resistance. The book explores how these photographers' work both benefited from and contributed to the changing roles of women in the American West, while also highlighting the complex legacy of their representations for both Native and non-Native audiences.
