In this innovative photographic study, Jane Simon examines how contemporary artists use domestic imagery to explore the self, moving beyond traditional portraiture to reveal the autobiographical potential of interior spaces and personal objects. Through careful analysis of works by photographers including Rinko Kawauchi, Catherine Opie, and Dayanita Singh, the book demonstrates how the act of photographic seeing and framing becomes a form of self-expression, offering scholars and artists new ways to understand the relationship between domestic spaces and personal identity.
