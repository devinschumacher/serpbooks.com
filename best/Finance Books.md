*The Political Origins of the Rise of Finance*

<br>

In "Capitalizing on Crisis, " Greta Krippner examines how the US economy became increasingly dependent on financial activities following the postwar period. Through extensive research, she demonstrates that the rise of finance was not a deliberate policy outcome, but rather an unintended consequence of state actions to address economic and social challenges beginning in the late 1960s. The book focuses on three key developments: the deregulation of financial markets in the 1970s and 1980s, the encouragement of foreign capital inflows to address fiscal imbalances in the early 1980s, and shifts in monetary policy following the 1979 interest rate hike. Krippner's work provides valuable insights into the historical evolution of finance and its impact on the broader turn to market-based solutions in US society.

"Finance and Inequality" explores the complex interplay between income disparity and financial sector development across multiple countries. The study, conducted by Martin Cihak and Ratna Sahay for the International Monetary Fund, examines how the size, accessibility, and stability of financial systems impact societal inequality. It reveals that while financial services have the potential to reduce income gaps through broader access and support for small businesses, poorly managed systems can exacerbate existing inequalities. The research underscores the importance of balancing financial sector growth with inclusive policies to create a more equitable economic environment.
