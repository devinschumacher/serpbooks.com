<br>

In this groundbreaking work, Andrea Resmini reframes information architecture for the post-digital age. Traditional concepts of web design and information hierarchy give way to a multi-disciplinary approach that blends digital and physical spaces. Drawing from architecture, urban planning, and cognitive science, this book explores how information spaces are becoming places we live in, where users are producers and products are complex cross-channel services. Through narratives and case studies, Resmini offers practical frameworks for making sense of information in an increasingly interconnected world.
