*Network Security Using Kerberos*

<br>

This network security study implements Kerberos encryption for client/server authentication and transaction validation. The research develops an Authentication Server that generates a 64-bit key from user passwords to encrypt ticket-granting tickets and session keys. The encrypted credentials are used by clients to perform authenticated transactions through a Transaction Server, which validates the tickets using a cross-referencing database. The project demonstrates how to enhance network security using Kerberos while addressing challenges in ticket validation and data encryption.
