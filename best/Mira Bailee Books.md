*Book 2, the Miramonde Series*

<br>

In this captivating sequel to The Miramonde Series, Amy Maroney weaves together the stories of a young Renaissance artist, Mira, and a modern-day scholar, Zari, as they piece together a collection of masterful portraits that have puzzled art historians for centuries. As Mira's peaceful coastal life is upended by a series of dangerous adventures in 1504, Zari races against time in 2015 to connect these groundbreaking works to their elusive female creator before it's too late. The year 1504 finds Mira, a promising artist in her own right, thrust into a web of secrets and danger when she and her husband attempt to help a friend, leaving them fighting for their very survival amidst their artistic pursuits. Meanwhile, in the present day, Zari's scholarly detective work unfolds across France as an academic rivalry threatens to overshadow the truth about these mysterious portraits. At stake is not just Mira's legacy, but the possibility of rewriting art history itself. Will their determination be enough to preserve the story of this remarkable Renaissance woman and her unsigned masterpieces? "Mira's Way" is a 394-page journey through time that challenges everything we thought we knew about Renaissance art and the artists who created it.
