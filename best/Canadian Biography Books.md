*Collective Biography and the Formation of the Canadian Middle Class*

<br>

"National Album: Collective Biography and the Formation of the Canadian Middle Class" analyzes three significant biographical dictionaries published between 1862 and 1903. Compiled by Henry James Morgan, George MacLean Rose, and William Cochrane, these works present detailed accounts of "representative" Canadians during a transformative period. Robert Lanning's examination uncovers the intricate relationship between occupation, mobility, and opportunity that influenced the developing middle class. The book also investigates the changing definition of success and the pronounced differences in men's and women's experiences. Drawing from historical sociology, the study reveals the "structure of feeling" that shaped Canadian culture and national identity in the late 19th century.

*The Life and Legend of John G. Diefenbaker*

<br>

This masterful biography chronicles the spectacular rise and turbulent fall of John G. Diefenbaker, the 13th prime minister of Canada. Elected in 1958 with the largest majority in the nation's history, Diefenbaker transformed a moribund Conservative Party into a force that rivaled the Liberals. Yet his leadership style, marked by both brilliant political maneuvering and reckless personal excesses, ultimately led to his ousting in 1967 and the fracturing of the party he worked so tirelessly to build. Through meticulous research and engaging prose, Denis Smith paints a nuanced portrait of a leader who, despite his flaws, left an indelible mark on Canadian politics and national identity.
