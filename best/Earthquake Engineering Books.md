## [Damage-Based Earthquake Engineering](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/DamageBased+Earthquake+Engineering?i=stripbooks)

![Damage-Based Earthquake Engineering | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/i0LbBQAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

Traditional earthquake engineering focuses on life-safety, but this book argues for designing structures to prevent damage as well. It presents a computational method to evaluate cumulative earthquake damage over a building's lifetime, combining probabilistic principles with structural analysis. The author demonstrates how to optimize damper placement to minimize lifecycle costs, supporting a shift toward more resilient structural design that accounts for frequent, smaller earthquakes which cause significant cumulative damage.
