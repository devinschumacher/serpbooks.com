<br>

In the decades following the Civil War, French art swept through the United States, fueling what would become known as the Gilded Age picture rush. Between 1867 and 1893, this transatlantic phenomenon not only reshaped private collections but also gave rise to institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Drawing from collectors' diaries, art dealers' records, and previously overlooked art histories, this study reveals how the commercial art system we know today took its first tentative steps in the glow of French Impressionism and Realism.
