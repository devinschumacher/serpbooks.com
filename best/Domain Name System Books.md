# Top 36 Domain Name System Books

The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names into the IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the internet. Without DNS, we'd have to remember the numerical IP addresses of every website we visit, making the internet a much less user-friendly place. These essential books range from DNS basics for newcomers to advanced topics for experienced network administrators, helping readers master this critical component of internet infrastructure.
