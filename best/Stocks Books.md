Getting Started in Stock Analysis is a visual guide that demonstrates why private investors need to employ both technical and fundamental analysis methods. Drawing from three decades of stock market experience, author Michael C. Thomsett explains how these approaches reveal different aspects of market behavior and how using one method at the expense of the other results in an incomplete picture. The book covers a range of indicators necessary for creating a working analysis system and shows how combining these techniques can produce more accurate and profitable investment decisions in today's fast-paced market environment.

*The Story of the Global Stock Market*

<br>

In "The Equity Culture, " B. Mark Smith presents a dynamic chronicle of how the global stock market evolved from 18th-century shipping magnates in India to the high-stakes trading floors of the 20th century. This expertly told story spans everything from joint stock companies and limited liability corporations to the speculative bubbles and market crashes that have shaped financial history. Smith's narrative highlights the market's inherent internationalism and its remarkable ability to reinvent itself through both regulation and innovation, making the case that "manias, panics, and crashes" are not just historical footnotes but pivotal forces that have defined the equity culture we know today.
