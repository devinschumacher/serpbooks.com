*Making and Taking in the Global Economy*

<br>

In this groundbreaking work, Mariana Mazzucato challenges the conventional wisdom of modern capitalism by distinguishing between value creation and value extraction. Drawing from diverse examples ranging from pharmaceutical pricing to corporate accountability, she argues that our current economic system rewards taking over making, leading to widespread misuse of the term "value. " The Value of Everything not only diagnoses this fundamental problem but also proposes a transformative vision for a more sustainable and inclusive capitalism, reigniting a crucial debate about the kind of world we want to live in.

*The End of Economic Reform in China?*

<br>

Since 1978, China has experienced unprecedented economic growth driven by market-oriented reforms. However, under President Xi Jinping, the country is witnessing a resurgence of state dominance that threatens to eclipse private enterprise and economic progress. Renowned China scholar Nicholas R. Lardy examines this critical juncture, arguing that while China's future growth prospects remain bright, they hinge on whether the nation will reverse course and return to market-focused policies. This timely sequel to Lardy's groundbreaking "Markets over Mao" analyzes Xi's impact on China's economic trajectory and the implications for the coming decades.

![The Case For People's Quantitative Easing | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/qsOlDwAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

After the 2008 financial crisis, central banks implemented quantitative easing (QE) to prevent deflation and restore economic growth. However, the trillions of dollars created through this policy ended up in the hands of the wealthy and large corporations rather than helping ordinary people and small businesses. In "The Case for People's Quantitative Easing, " Frances Coppola argues for a more equitable approach that directs monetary stimulus directly to those who need it most, while addressing long-term challenges like aging populations and climate change.

This approach, they argue, has generated middle-class prosperity and supported democratic governance, countering the notion that advanced capitalism undermines democratic institutions.

*Institutional Set-ups and Monetary Policy Effectiveness*

<br>

Over the past three decades, inflation targeting (IT) has emerged as the dominant monetary policy framework among larger economies, yet its implementation varies significantly across central banks. This comprehensive study examines the institutional arrangements of 42 IT central banks, analyzing how differences in independence, accountability, and transparency affect their ability to meet policy goals. Based on a detailed assessment of 70 related aspects over 30 years, the author demonstrates that the quality of institutional set-ups materially influences monetary policy effectiveness. The book not only identifies the sources of IT strengths but also provides valuable insights for central banks considering adoption or modification of the framework. Supported by supplementary indices evaluating individual monetary authorities, this work offers essential reading for scholars, researchers, and policymakers involved in monetary economics and policy formulation.

## [The International Political Economy of the Renminbi](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/The+International+Political+Economy+of+the+Renminbi?i=stripbooks)

![The International Political Economy of the Renminbi | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/mzFCEAAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

*Currency Internationalization and Reactive Currency Statecraft*

<br>

This groundbreaking work examines how major economies responded to the renminbi's internationalization during its crucial developmental phase through the 2010s. Unlike existing literature that focuses narrowly on China, the issuer of the currency, Hyoung-kyu Chey develops a theoretical framework called reactive currency statecraft to analyze the policies of four key nations: the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, and the United States. The study reveals that despite being China's primary geopolitical and currency rivals, these countries overwhelmingly adopted accommodative policies, leveraging renminbi internationalization to achieve their own foreign policy objectives. This work offers valuable insights into the evolving world monetary order and the complex international politics surrounding China's economic rise.

<br>

In this rigorous examination of the growing tension between democracy and capitalism, Financial Times chief economics commentator Martin Wolf argues that these two systems, despite their fundamental compatibility, face a crisis of alignment that threatens the future of liberal democracy itself. wolf demonstrates how the slowdown of economic growth and the widening wealth gap have created fertile ground for authoritarianism, both in the United States and globally. Through careful analysis of the policies that have led to this divergence, he provides a compelling case for why a separation of capitalism from democracy would be catastrophic, offering instead a hopeful vision of how we can restore harmony between our political and economic systems through renewed commitment to the common good.
