*Languages without multiple wh-questions*

<br>

This monograph explores an intriguing linguistic phenomenon shared by Irish, Berber, Italian, and Somali: the ungrammaticality of multiple wh-questions in these languages.

The study not only contributes to the crosslinguistic classification of wh-constructions but also offers deeper insights into information structure and focusing phenomena in natural languages.

*The New Science of Human Individuality*

<br>

In this groundbreaking work, renowned neuroscientist David J. Linden explores the biological roots of human individuality, drawing from his personal experience on dating sites to examine how our unique personalities emerge from the interplay of genes and environment. Spanning from prenatal development to adult behavior, "Unique" reveals how human differences arise not from nature versus nurture, but from a dynamic "mélange of genes continually responding to our experiences in the world. " Through meticulous scientific inquiry, Linden demonstrates why these individual differences are crucial for our ability to live together in diverse societies, offering both rigorous research and accessible insights into what makes each person truly unique.

*Its Syntactic and Semantic Properties*

<br>

"Why is 'Why' Unique? Its Syntactic and Semantic Properties" examines the behavior of the wh-element 'why' across ten languages, exploring its interactions with V2 constructions, subject clitics, and its merge position in different linguistic environments. The book establishes a distinction between high and low reason adverbials, investigates why-stripping environments in Dutch, and examines special wh-expressions that generate unexpected why-construals with pragmatic force. Through ten original chapters and experimental studies on prosody, this work provides a comprehensive analysis of 'why' at the syntax-semantics interface.

*Evolution and the Two Structures of Mind*

<br>

What Makes Humans Unique explores the dual structure of the human mind through an integrated multi-disciplinary lens. Michael Robbins proposes that our capacity for reflective representational thought, developed during the prolonged post-natal period of immaturity known as neoteny, allows for the acquisition of complex knowledge and shapes our individual and collective future as a species. This book offers an alternative to Freud's model of the human mind, highlighting the limitations of his theory in light of modern biological and social sciences.
