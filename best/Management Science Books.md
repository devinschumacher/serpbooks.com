This regulatory study examines price discrimination in the over-the-counter FX derivatives market, revealing significant disparities between sophisticated and non-financial clients. The research, based on new regulatory data, demonstrates how dealers exploit search frictions to charge higher spreads to less experienced clients, particularly through bilateral negotiations. The study also highlights the role of market opacity and client captivity in enabling these discriminatory practices, while noting that multi-dealer request-for-quote platforms help mitigate these issues.
