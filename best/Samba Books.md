*Spiritism in Brazil*

<br>

Available for the first time in English, this groundbreaking work by Japanese researcher Yoshimi Yoshiaki exposes the shocking details of the military's role in operating comfort stations across Asia during World War II. Drawing from extensive documentation and survivor testimony, the book reveals the systematic imprisonment and sexual exploitation of approximately 200,000 women from Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan, and other occupied territories. Many were teenagers, some as young as fourteen, forcibly restrained for months and subjected to daily rapes by Japanese military personnel. While Korean women initiated lawsuits in 1991 demanding recognition and compensation, the Japanese government has yet to acknowledge its responsibility for creating this widespread system of sexual slavery. This updated edition includes critical introductions placing the events in historical context and examines the ongoing debate over public memory and historical accountability that continues to haunt Japan's postwar legacy.
