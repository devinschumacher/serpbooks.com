*Africanist Aesthetics and Equity in the Twenty-First Century*

<br>

This groundbreaking book challenges the Eurocentric narrative that has shaped jazz dance theory and practice, centering instead on the art form's Africanist origins and Black American heritage. Through scholarly research and practical applications, the authors examine how systemic erasure of jazz dance's roots has led to the dominance of European techniques and aesthetics. "Rooted Jazz Dance" presents decolonizing strategies for teaching, choreographing, and performing jazz dance that honor its Africanist principles and address the historical misappropriation of this vital American art form.
