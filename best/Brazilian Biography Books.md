Dulles examines the dictator's contradictory legacy, highlighting the social and economic policies that earned him both praise as the "Father of the Brazilians" and condemnation from his political foes. Drawing from State Department papers and numerous interviews, this meticulously researched account reveals the personal struggles and strategic brilliance of the man who, facing deposition once again in 1954, chose a tragic end rather than surrender his vision for Brazil's future.

*Brazil*

<br>

In 1919, Brazil emerged as a global power at the Paris Peace Conference, led by the brilliant lawyer Epitacio Pessoa. As the Portuguese-speaking nation negotiated its place among world nations, Pessoa secured critical deals for Brazilian coffee and won his country a seat in the League of Nations. However, this period of international triumph masked the growing political instability at home. The book recounts how Pessoa's presidency ended in failure amid military revolts, while Brazil's political system crumbled between elite factions. By 1930, the First Republic had collapsed, leaving Pessoa to begin a new career as an international judge. "Epitacio Pessoa: Brazil" weaves together three decades of history through the story of one remarkable legal mind who served his country at the highest levels of national and international politics.

*The Triumph and Tragedy of Brazil's Forgotten Footballing Hero*

<br>

In the sweltering summer of 1958, an unassuming Brazilian footballer named Garrincha emerged from obscurity to rewrite the annals of the sport during the World Cup Finals against the Soviet Union. With a physicality that defied conventional wisdom - his right leg turned inward while his left splayed outward - this awkward genius transformed himself from curious oddity to international icon in just three extraordinary minutes of gameplay. Off the pitch, his life mirrored the same disregard for convention that made him a legend on it, forging a passionate union with singer Elza Soares that became as much a part of his story as his groundbreaking techniques. Yet, the very qualities that fueled his meteoric rise also ignited a personal turmoil that would cut his life tragically short, leaving behind a legacy that Brazilian football continues to cherish and study.
