## [Ray Tracing in the Troposphere, Ionosphere and Magnetosphere](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Ray+Tracing+in+the+Troposphere+Ionosphere+and+Magnetosphere?i=stripbooks)

![Ray Tracing in the Troposphere, Ionosphere and Magnetosphere | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/phtcO2YahPYC?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

This technical report examines the propagation of radio signals through the troposphere, ionosphere, and magnetosphere under super-refracting conditions. It presents ray patterns that illustrate how these signals travel large distances by ducting through regions of the atmosphere where the refractive index deviates slightly from the free-space value. The author emphasizes the formal similarities between ducting phenomena in these three atmospheric layers, providing a comprehensive view of radio signal propagation through the Earth's electromagnetic environment.
