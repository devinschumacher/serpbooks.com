In the Big Easy, where dragons soars through the smoky air of gambling dens and the Mississippi River winds through the heart of the city, Robert Asprin and Jody Lynn Nye weave a tale of ambition and betrayal. When Griffen McCandles, a successful dragon entrepreneur, is offered the coveted position of king for the Krewe of Fafnir's Mardi Gras parade, he accepts despite the growing shadows of conspiracy that threaten to consume everything he holds dear. In this high-stakes story of leadership and loyalty, the authors blend rich dragon lore with the gritty reality of running a business in New Orleans, where the line between magic and murder is dangerously thin.
