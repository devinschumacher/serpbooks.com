*Battles over Public Funding for the "Other Sciences" at the National Science Foundation*

<br>

In the early years of the Cold War, the U. S. government created the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support civilian scientific research. Initially focused on the natural sciences, the agency's enabling legislation included a vague reference to "other sciences, " which soon opened the door to social science funding. This decision sparked ongoing debates about the scientific status and social relevance of the social sciences within the NSF's mission. Mark Solovey's book examines how the NSF became a significant, though contentious, patron for social science research, shaping the field's development and public perception.

<br>

In "The Logic of Social Science, " James Mahoney presents scientific constructivism as a bridge between scientific and constructivist approaches in social science research. Arguing that social science categories are human-constructed yet correspond to external reality, Mahoney develops a set-theoretic analysis that applies mathematical logic to understand how these categories exist in the mind and how they can be studied scientifically. This work establishes a framework for social science research that overcomes essentialist thinking while maintaining rigorous scientific standards.
