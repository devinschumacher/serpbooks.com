This carefully selected collection brings together leading medieval, early modern, and modern historians to explore when and how the nation became a fundamental political factor. Their work bridges the gap between 'modernist' views that confine the political nation to industrialized societies and the perspectives of pre-industrial historians who emphasize the central role of nations in medieval and early modern political life. Through rigorous examination of the nation as both concept and 'imagined community, ' these essays offer valuable insights into the enduring impact of national identity on European history.
