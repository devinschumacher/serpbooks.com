In this influential 1974 monograph, Professor Martin L. Cody presents a comprehensive theory of how competition shapes bird communities across North and South America. Drawing from extensive field studies of eleven distinct bird populations, Cody demonstrates how species segregate along resource gradients through competitive interactions, ultimately determining the structure of ecological communities. The book explores three key dimensions of competition - habitat types, foraging sites, and food sources - while also examining the broader implications of these findings for understanding niche evolution and resource allocation in nature.

*What's Holding Back Health Care and how to Free it*

<br>

In this updated edition of their 2005 work, Michael F. Cannon and Michael Tanner argue that government control has been the driving force behind both the soaring costs and declining quality of American health care. As policymakers consider new regulations that would expand government oversight even further, the authors make a compelling case for reducing bureaucratic involvement and increasing individual freedom in the health care sector. Timely and insightful, "Healthy Competition" offers a detailed examination of how government planning has impacted health care, supported by data and analysis that highlight the need for systemic reform.

<br>

Modern bank competition policy faces a paradox: while financial services markets are increasingly contestable, traditional tools focusing on market structure show limited effectiveness. In this advanced economy context, where banks operate with low charter values and high risk incentives, Lev Ratnovski argues for a policy shift. Rather than regulating concentration, competition policy should address 'too-big-to-fail' concerns and define permissible activities. This refined approach also considers temporary measures to facilitate bank resolution following financial crises, balancing market dynamics with regulatory oversight.

*Rule of Law and the Economic Approach to Competition*

In this meticulously argued legal treatise, Bruce Wardhaugh dissects the fundamental tensions between the European 'More Economic Approach' and the US Rule of Reason in competition law.

Wardhaugh scrutinizes the institutional frameworks and legal principles that underpin modern competition law, revealing how effects-based analysis threatens to undermine the rule of law. This work stands as a significant contribution to both European and American competition law scholarship, offering policymakers and legal practitioners a nuanced understanding of the trade-offs inherent in antitrust regulation.
