*The Sense and Nonsense of Alternative Medicine*

<br>

In this meticulously researched expose, medical expert Paul A. Offit, M. D. , dissects the alternative medicine industry, revealing the stark contrast between therapies that work and those that don't. Drawing from dramatic real-life cases, this 291-page volume demonstrates why no health practice, alternative or traditional, should escape rigorous scrutiny. Offit, an outspoken advocate for science-based medicine, shows how the unregulated nature of alternative therapies can lead to costly mistakes and even harm. Yet he also highlights the remarkable effectiveness of some nontraditional methods that conventional medicine often overlooks. This work serves as both a warning against unproven treatments and a guide to understanding the complexities of modern healthcare.
