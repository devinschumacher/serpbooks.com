*The Aesthetics of Possibility*

<br>

Widely heard and read throughout the Middle Ages, romance literature has persisted for centuries and re-emerged in speculative fiction, inviting readers to step out of the actual world and experience the intriguing pleasure of possibility. This interdisciplinary study examines the genre's deep philosophical underpinnings through Leibniz's "possible worlds" theory, Kant's aesthetic reflections, and Gadamer's writings on literary transmission. Analyzing six instances of medieval secular writing, including works by Marie de France, the Gawain-poet, and Chaucer, the authors demonstrate how these extravagantly imagined worlds invite reflection on the nature of reality itself.
