*Rediscovering the Lost City One Step at a Time*

When an unadventurous travel writer sets out to retrace Hiram Bingham's 1911 expedition to Machu Picchu, he trades his comfort zone for one of the world's most remote and breathtaking landscapes. Guided by a hard-as-nails Australian survivalist, Mark Adams discovers that recreating history is far more challenging than writing about it. As they navigate through the Andes Mountains of Peru, Adams confronts not only the physical demands of the journey but also the enduring mystery of Machu Picchu itself. This New York Times bestseller weaves together adventure, history, and self-discovery in a tale that questions everything we thought we knew about the Lost City of the Incas.

<br>

Beyond the familiar fifty states lies a patchwork of American territories scattered across the Pacific and Caribbean, home to four million people often overlooked in discussions of what it means to be American. Travel writer Doug Mack set out to explore these "not-quite states, " from the U. S. Virgin Islands to American Samoa, uncovering the histories that shaped their unique relationships with the mainland. Along the way, he found American flags and Little League games coexisting with ancient Polynesian traditions and ongoing debates over political status. Through 30,000 miles of globe-hopping, Mack reveals why these territories matter: they challenge our notions of what it means to be part of the United States and offer fascinating insights into the nature of empire itself.
