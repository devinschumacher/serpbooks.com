Between the 1930s and 1970s, Latin American publishers wielded books as powerful tools of cultural unification amidst a backdrop of political and economic turmoil. This 258-page Routledge publication examines how the symbolic weight of publishing intersected with nationalistic ideologies, from the early influence of Americanism to the Cold War's shaping of Latin Americanism. Through a carefully curated blend of theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence, author Gustavo Sorá illustrates the complex relationship between book publication and regional integration, highlighting the enduring impact of this period on contemporary Latin American culture.

What is Latin American History? offers a concise overview of how this field of study has evolved in North America, Latin America, and Europe. After touching on its development up to the 1960s, the book examines the past half-century's shift from social history to cultural studies. It highlights innovative research on slavery, indigenous peoples, race, the environment, science, medicine, and gender, before exploring how concepts like borderlands, the Atlantic world, and transnational history have reshaped both Latin America and its academic study.

*History, Society, Culture*

<br>

Healthcare in Latin America: History, Society, Culture examines the development of public health systems across the region, from Argentina to Puerto Rico. The book explores how national governments have used healthcare policies to gain political legitimacy and address social inequalities. Through interdisciplinary research, the volume compares modern biomedical practices with traditional Indigenous healing methods and discusses critical issues such as universal health coverage, maternal care, and healthcare disparities. The contributors, including scholars from history and cultural studies, highlight the complex interplay between economic shifts, independence movements, and continued inequities that have shaped Latin American healthcare systems throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.
