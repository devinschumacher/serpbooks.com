*One Chemist's Single-Minded Crusade for Food Safety at the Turn of the Twentieth Century*

<br>

At the turn of the twentieth century, American food was a dangerous business. Milk contained formaldehyde, and meat was preserved with industrial chemicals like borax and salicylic acid. When Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley took over as chief chemist of the agriculture department in 1883, he launched a groundbreaking investigation into food fraud, creating a team of young men known as "The Poison Squad" to test the safety of everyday foods. Over the next thirty years, Wiley battled tirelessly for food safety regulations, working alongside muckraking journalist Upton Sinclair and pioneering cookbook author Fannie Farmer to protect consumers from harmful additives. Their efforts culminated in the landmark 1906 Food and Drug Act, a victory that transformed American food safety standards and stood as a powerful example of standing up to corporate greed.

In this insightful analysis, Faith Agostinone-Wilson examines how right-wing populism and fascism have surged in media, fueled by politicians who normalize authoritarian discourse and scapegoating. She critiques the Left's ineffective responses, from liberal free-speech policies to socialist tunnel vision on economic issues, and demonstrates why a Marxist feminist framework is essential for understanding how racism, sexism, and homophobia serve capitalist interests. Through dialectical materialist feminism and critical examination of online spaces, abortion rights, and anti-science sentiment, this work provides a comprehensive look at the ideological battles shaping our future.
