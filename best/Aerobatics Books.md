## [The Effect of Drugs in Altering Susceptibility to Motion Sickness in Aerobatics and the Slow Rotation Room](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/The+Effect+of+Drugs+in+Altering+Susceptibility+to+Motion+Sickness+in+Aerobatics+and+the+Slow+Rotation+Room?i=stripbooks)

<br>

This study investigates how seven anti-motion sickness drugs and three placebos affect susceptibility to motion sickness in aerobatics and the Slow Rotation Room. Ten men participated in twenty-four aerobatic maneuvers in an A1E 'Skyraider' aircraft and performed the Pensacola Slow Rotation Room Dial Test. The research compares the rank order of drug effectiveness and subject susceptibility under both conditions, finding significant individual differences in drug response. While susceptibility in the Slow Rotation Room generally predicted susceptibility in aerobatics for eight subjects, two cases showed gross prediction errors. The study concludes that a combination of scopolamine and d-amphetamine was the most effective treatment under both conditions.
