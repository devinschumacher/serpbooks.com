<br>

This comprehensive study examines the challenges of growing high-quality tobacco leaves in western Henan Province, China, where changing climate patterns have led to increased drought stress during the critical fast-growing period. Through detailed analysis of rainfall data from 1986 to 2022 in both Sanmenxia and Luoyang tobacco-growing areas, researchers identified significant seasonal variations that affect crop development. To address these challenges, the study evaluates four key drought-resistance technologies: water-holding agents, antitranspirants, optimized nitrogen fertilization, and chemical regulators. Using randomized block design experiments in both regions, the research team compared the effectiveness of these technologies across tobacco varieties Yunyan87 and LY1306, measuring their impact on agronomic traits, root activity, and metabolic processes. The results provide valuable insights into the coordinated use of these technologies to maintain crop quality under varying environmental conditions, offering practical solutions for tobacco growers in similar subtropical-warm temperate transition zones.
