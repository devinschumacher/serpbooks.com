In this compelling collection of three detective novels set in Botswana, Assistant Superintendent David 'Kubu' Bengu returns to solve a series of dark, devastating crimes that challenge the very core of his being. The first novel follows Kubu and his brilliant young colleague, Detective Samantha Khama, as they investigate the mysterious disappearance of two young girls, leading them to uncover a chilling pattern of murder linked to traditional African medicine. The second novel hits particularly close to home when Kubu's own father is murdered, thrusting him into a complex web of international crime involving Chinese mine-owners and US Embassy officials. In the final novel, an ancient Bushman's body is found near the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, but his youthful internal organs and a mysterious bullet wound suggest anything but a simple accident. As the investigation unfolds, Kubu matches wits with ruthless criminals in a high-stakes tale of corruption and deception that spans from the dusty streets of Botswana to the shadowy underworld of international crime. This collection marks the fourth, fifth, and sixth books in THE DETECTIVE KUBU COLLECTION, showcasing the operatic intensity and winelike complexity that has defined the series.
