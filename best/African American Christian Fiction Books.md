*Seeking Social Justice in a Northern Suburb*

<br>

In this groundbreaking work, Betty Livingston Adams sheds light on the pivotal role of working-class black women in shaping northern suburbs and American Protestantism at the dawn of the twentieth century. Through the lens of Violet Johnson, a domestic servant who dared to challenge Summit, New Jersey's racial and class barriers, Adams reveals how ordinary African American women navigated and transformed their religious and civic landscapes. Johnson's establishment of a Baptist church in 1897 set in motion a legacy of Christian activism that would grant her community an equal place in a Christian nation. Drawing from previously untapped archival sources, this meticulously researched study demonstrates how religion became a powerful tool for social justice, offering new insights into the civil rights movement's roots and the enduring impact of these visionary women.
