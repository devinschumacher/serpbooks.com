*From the Gilded Age through the Great Depression*

This comprehensive criminological study examines violent crime in America from the 1880s through the 1930s, challenging conventional wisdom that casts the period as one of unbridled urban violence. LSU Press published the work in 2021, highlighting author Barry Latzer's synthesis of historical scholarship and original research that reveals rural areas, particularly the South and Western frontier, experienced higher rates of violent crime than crowded, impoverished cities. The study also debunks the notion that Prohibition fueled widespread criminality, instead arguing that the elimination of saloons reduced hubs of vice and lawlessness across the nation.
