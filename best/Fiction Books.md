*A new perspective on life in the anthropocene*

<br>

Climate Fiction and Cultural Analysis explores how the genre of climate fiction has evolved to encompass a wide range of climatic events, threatening to dilute its original purpose. The book argues that by focusing on anthropogenic global warming, climate fiction can reclaim its speculative power and serve as a vital complement to climate science. Through an analysis of English and German climate fictions, the book demonstrates how these works employ recurring imaginaries to depict future modes of existence within scientifically anticipated scenarios of ecological change.

*Spatialising the Literary Text*

<br>

Maps play a crucial role in fiction, from Treasure Island to Winnie-the-Pooh, by merging written language with spatial representation. This literary criticism examines how authors use cartographic elements to bridge textual descriptions with reader comprehension. Analyzing several fictional works, it demonstrates the enhanced reading experience that comes from integrating maps strategically within the narrative text. The book argues that these visual aids provide deeper insights into the stories' geographical dimensions, serving as vital links between the written word and the reader's mental map.

In a masterful work that spans from the vibrant stages of 19th-century theater to the quiet desperation of a family farm thirty miles northeast of Baltimore, Karen Joy Fowler weaves the true story of John Wilkes Booth's siblings into the fracturing fabric of pre-Civil War America.

Behind the curtains of their father's dramatic performances, these ten Booth children will encounter scandals, triumphs, and ultimately, the devastating consequences of a household that could neither contain nor control its most notorious member.
