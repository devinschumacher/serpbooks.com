*Uncertain Landscapes*

<br>

Since its independence in 1971, Bangladesh has achieved remarkable economic growth and poverty reduction, making it a significant international development success story. However, these achievements exist alongside a challenging political landscape marked by governance weaknesses. This book explores this intriguing paradox through four interconnected sections: Political Settlement, Elites and Deep Structures; Democracy, Citizenship and Values; Civil Society, Local Context and Political Change; and Informality and Accountability. Drawing from expert analyses and structural determinism, the text offers both theoretical insights and practical implications for governance and politics in developing countries, particularly in South Asia.
