<br>

On April 25, 1974, a spontaneous revolution erupted in Portugal, as ordinary citizens poured into the streets of Lisbon to challenge the fascist government of Estado Novo. This popular uprising, later known as the Carnation Revolution, brought together diverse movements for independence in Portugal's African colonies, rebellion within the military, and the long-suppressed demands of the working classes. Through the organizing power of these coalitions, a popular-front government took hold, leading to Portugal's withdrawal from its overseas colonies and the implementation of sweeping social changes.
