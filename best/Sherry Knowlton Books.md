*A Labor of Love*

<br>

In the heart of Arizona's mining country, three small towns emerged and then vanished, leaving only this remarkable account of their brief existence. Sonora, Ray, and Barcelona sprang to life through the efforts of local miners andMexican laborers, building homes and raising families in the shadow of the Ray Mines. As the mining pit grew, these tightly-knit communities were slowly consumed, their streets and buildings reclaimed by the earth. This labor of love stands as a poignant tribute to the families who lived and worked in these now-forgotten towns, their stories told through the lens of a daughter honoring her roots in Arizona's mining heritage.
