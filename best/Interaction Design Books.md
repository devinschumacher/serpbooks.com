<br>

In "The Design of Implicit Interactions, " Wendy Ju explores how everyday human interactions drive our expectations of digital devices. Drawing from observations of non-verbal communication and joint action, Ju introduces the Implicit Interaction Framework to map these natural interaction patterns. Through case studies of "smart" devices and interactive systems, the book demonstrates how designers can refine their creations to better integrate into our daily lives. Ju also examines the social dimensions of user-device interaction and outlines considerations for prototyping implicitly interactive technologies. This work bridges the gap between human-human and human-machine interaction design, offering practical tools for creating more intuitive and effective interactive systems.
