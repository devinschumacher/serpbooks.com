*Mexico's Experiments with Disease Prevention in the Age of Reason*

<br>

In eighteenth-century Mexico, outbreaks of typhus and smallpox triggered collaborations between residents, administrators, priests, and doctors to restore stability and improve public health. This book examines the cultural, ritual, and political foundations of Mexico's early vaccination efforts, showing how public health programs evolved through interactions between indigenous practices, Enlightenment medicine, and religious traditions. Paul Ramírez argues that effective disease prevention required cooperation across ethnic, gender, and class lines, as local officials, rural priests, and parents navigated new medical knowledge amidst their existing beliefs and practices.
