![James Monroe | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/iHInEAAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

*A Life*

<br>

From the battlefields of the American Revolution to his own presidency, this meticulously researched biography follows James Monroe through the most pivotal moments of early American history. As a soldier, he fought alongside George Washington and nearly dueled with Alexander Hamilton; as a diplomat, he negotiated the Louisiana Purchase and led the nation during the War of 1812; and as president, he strengthened American power both at home and abroad. Tim McGrath draws from extensive primary sources to tell the story of the man who helped transform thirteen colonies into a vibrant republic, capturing every dimension of Monroe's complex legacy, including his troubled relationship with slavery. This book stands as a masterful portrait of one of America's most underappreciated Founding Fathers, offering readers a intimate look at the personality who bridged the gap between Washington's generation and the future of the nation.
