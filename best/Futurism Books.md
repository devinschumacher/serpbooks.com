*Word and Images in Futurism and Surrealism*

<br>

"The Culture of Fragments" explores how words and images intersect in early 20th-century art, focusing on works that blur the boundary between poetry and painting. Through analyses of Marinetti's parole in libertà, Boccioni's newspaper collages, Breton's Clair de terre, and Magritte's surreal compositions, this study demonstrates how these artists liberated language from traditional constraints to create new forms of expression. The book also examines how this revolutionary approach to word-image relations influenced other media, including theater and cinema, making it a valuable resource for scholars of French and Italian modernism as well as word-image studies.

*The Art and Politics of Artificial Optimism*

<br>

In 1909, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti ignited the Italian Futurist movement with a provocative manifesto that celebrated "the love of danger" and "the beauty of speed. " This influential artistic and political wave, however, has faced decades of neglect due to its controversial embrace of violence and nationalism. Christine Poggi's groundbreaking "Inventing Futurism" reexamines this pivotal movement within the broader context of Italian social history, revealing the profound ambivalence and anxiety that lay beneath its avant-garde facade. Through meticulous analysis of Futurist literature, art, and politics, Poggi explores their complex responses to industrial modernity, mass influence, gender roles, and war's destructiveness. Her work traces the movement's evolution from its explosive beginnings to its transformations under Fascism, offering unprecedented insights into Futurism's most enduring themes and its legacy as a powerful force in modern art.

*A Manifesto for Nonsense*

<br>

In this groundbreaking work, Helen Palmer brings together Deleuze's complex philosophies of space, time, and language with the revolutionary ideas of futurism. Through meticulous analysis of Russian and Italian futurist manifestos, Palmer reveals the striking parallels between Deleuze's linguistic innovations and the avant-garde's most provocative works. The book explores how both Deleuze and the futurists sought to transcend conventional language, often through what appears to be nonsensical or paradoxical statements. Palmer examines the philosophical foundations of futurist "zaum" (transrational) language and its echoes in Deleuze's seminal works like "Difference and Repetition" and "The Logic of Sense. " The result is a profound meditation on how language itself becomes a medium for philosophical exploration, where words and concepts bend to new meanings and possibilities.

*Sound, Image, and Word in Russian Futurist Book Art*

<br>

Between 1910 and 1915, a group of Russian artists and poets created a series of hand-lithographed books that revolutionized the medium. Fusing verbal, visual, and sonic elements into a new language called zaum, these works rejected traditional logic in favor of "sound as such. " At the heart of this volume are two groundbreaking futurist books, Mirskontsa (Worldbackwards) and Vzorval' (Explodity), which Nancy Perloff analyzes in the context of both Russian avant-garde and global art movements. The book also explores the lasting influence of these works on sound and concrete poetry, contemporary conceptual art, and the artist's book, accompanied by audio recordings of zaum poems available online.
