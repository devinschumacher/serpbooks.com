When Hannah Hall's daughter Rosie starts school in the picturesque coastal town of Fairlight, it kicks off a chain of events that will challenge everything Hannah thought she knew about parenting. As an intellectual giftedness becomes increasingly apparent, Rosie's new teacher Alice Spencer develops a tailored educational plan that clashes with Hannah's more traditional approach. The story unfolds against the backdrop of their crumbling old schoolhouse, where personal demons and professional differences collide. Will these two strong-willed women find common ground before it's too late? "Second Chances" by Amanda Radley is a compelling look at how our childhood experiences shape our parenting decisions and the delicate balance between protecting and challenging our children.
