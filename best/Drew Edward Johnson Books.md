In this insightful collection of ten essays, Jim Shepard examines how American films shape our understanding of ourselves and our role in the world. Through close readings of classics like GoodFellas, Lawrence of Arabia, and Badlands, Shepard reveals the ways cinema reflects and influences our most deeply held beliefs about collective responsibility and national identity. His work highlights the persistent illusions we maintain about our country's actions abroad and the "lunatic serenity" with which our leaders pursue their goals, offering a powerful critique of the self-deceptions that allow us to maintain these beliefs despite conflicting evidence.

*The Prehistoric Golden Age and the Mythic Origins of Humanity*

<br>

Noted historian Geoffrey Ashe presents a compelling argument that human civilization's first advanced culture emerged in the Altai-Baikal region of southern Siberia, dating back to 24,000 BC. This matrifocal society, characterized by Goddess worship and shamanic practices, served as the source of numerous mythic traditions that would influence cultures worldwide. Ashe demonstrates how this prehistoric civilization gave rise to the sacred symbolism of the number 7, the concept of a "sacred mountain to the North, " and the seven-note musical scale, while also shaping Indian Vedic traditions and Greek mythology. Through multidisciplinary evidence, he challenges conventional notions of cultural diffusion, revealing how early societies looked to the past for perfection rather than the future.
