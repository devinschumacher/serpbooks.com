This technical report examines the application of lightweight threads to data parallel scientific computing, highlighting their potential to improve performance through asynchronous execution and overlapping computation with communication latency. The authors, from the Institute for Computer Applications in Science and Engineering, compare threaded approaches to traditional parallel programming models, demonstrating the benefits of runtime scheduling and encapsulated units of work. The report also critically evaluates whether similar performance gains can be achieved with asynchronous communication primitives alone, providing insights into the evolving landscape of parallel programming for scientific applications.
