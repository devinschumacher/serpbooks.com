*From School Space to Marketplace*

<br>

When the George W. Bush administration passed the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001, they included groundbreaking military recruiting mandates for public high schools that fundamentally changed how the armed forces interact with students. This legislation required high schools to share student directory information annually with local recruiting stations and grant military recruiters equal access to school grounds as university or career recruiters. The 2015 renewal of this law under the Every Student Succeeds Act not only maintained these provisions but prohibited local school boards from implementing opt-in structures for parents and students. This 146-page Springer publication examines how these policies have been implemented across the country, exploring whether military recruiting methods in public high schools align with students' best interests or if policymakers need to reconsider the regulations governing these interactions.
