*The Crosby Brown Collection of Musical Instruments*

<br>

Published to celebrate the reopening of The Met's André Mertens Galleries for Musical Instruments after a two-year renovation, this Bulletin chronicles the remarkable journey of Mary Elizabeth Adams Brown, a mother of six who built an unparalleled collection of over 3,600 musical instruments from around the world in the late nineteenth century. Through her great-granddaughter Sally B. Brown's intimate exploration, we learn how this extraordinary collector, without any musical training, assembled a diverse array of instruments that would form the foundation of The Met's musical instruments department. Mary Elizabeth's groundbreaking work extended beyond acquisition to authoring the first catalogue of a musical instruments collection in the United States, establishing her as an esteemed authority in the field. This publication showcases selections from her groundbreaking collection, highlighting the two-thirds of works from non-European cultures that reflect her ambitious departure from the Western canon.

In this insightful work, Haruki Murakami reveals the personal and creative forces that shaped him into one of the world's most distinctive novelists. Drawing from his own experiences and the "seminal role" of a carrier pigeon in his career, Murakami explores the interplay between author and work, where "while the novelist is creating a novel, he is simultaneously being created by the novel as well. " The book delves into the importance of memory, the necessity of loneliness, and the author's iconic running routine, offering both aspiring writers and devoted readers a intimate look at the craft of storytelling.
