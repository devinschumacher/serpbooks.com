*Thomas Hirschhorn: The Bijlmer Spinoza-Festival. The Ambassador's Diary*

<br>

In 2009, Swiss artist Thomas Hirschhorn created an extraordinary sculpture in Amsterdam's Bijlmer neighborhood that would change how we think about art's relationship to time and place. Through the eyes of art historian Vittoria Martini, who was invited to witness this "precarious" work firsthand, we explore how Hirschhorn's creation continues to exist in our minds long after its physical disappearance. Their collaboration gives rise to a new methodology Martini calls "precarious art history, " showing us how art can touch and transform us all.
