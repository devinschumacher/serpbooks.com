*A Concise History*

<br>

"Computing: A Concise History" by Paul E. Ceruzzi traces the remarkable evolution of digital technology from its inception in the late 19th century to the sophisticated devices that define our connected world today. This MIT Press publication examines four pivotal threads that have shaped computing's development: the adoption of binary code, the convergence of diverse technological streams, the exponential improvement of electronic components, and the revolution in human-computer interaction. Through key milestones like the ENIAC and UNIVAC computers, and the emergence of the Internet and social networking, Ceruzzi illustrates how these foundational elements have combined to transform computing from a room-sized ensemble of machinery to the "minicomputers" and smart devices that dominate our daily lives. This accessible history highlights the brilliance of figures like the Bell Labs mathematician who coined the term "digital" in 1892, and the relentless drive that has shrunk once-massive computing power down to the palm of our hands.
