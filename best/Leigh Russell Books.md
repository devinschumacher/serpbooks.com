*The 1969 NBA Finals: Wilt, Russ, Lakers, Celtics, and a Very Young Sports Reporter*

<br>

In this dynamic chronicle of the 1969 NBA Finals, young sports reporter Leigh Montville captures the raw energy and historic significance of basketball's most towering figures, Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain, as their legendary teams collide in a seven-game series that defined an era.
