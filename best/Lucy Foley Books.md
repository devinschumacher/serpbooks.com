Gawande presents visionary alternatives to traditional nursing home and hospital care, demonstrating how we can transform the end of life from a medical battleground to a rich, dignified experience. Drawing from his own practice and extensive study, he shows that it's possible to provide not just good medical care, but good end-of-life care that honors our shared desire for meaning and connection in medicine's final chapter.

As Natalie races against time to bring her sister back, she uncovers a web of secrets that threatens to upend everything they thought they knew about their family.
