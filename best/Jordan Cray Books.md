Tensor categories represent a sophisticated mathematical framework that extends the classical theory of vector spaces and group representations. This comprehensive text introduces readers to the core concepts of tensor categories, with a particular emphasis on finite tensor categories and fusion categories. The authors explore the intricate connections between tensor categories and various mathematical disciplines, including Hopf algebras, operator algebras, and low-dimensional topology. Through a series of exercises and detailed proofs, the book demonstrates how the properties of finite-dimensional Hopf algebras emerge naturally from tensor category theory. Each chapter concludes with discussions of applications, connections to other fields, and additional resources, making this an invaluable reference for mathematicians and physicists alike.
