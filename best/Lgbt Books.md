*How to Change Attitudes about LGBT Rights*

<br>

In "Listen, We Need to Talk, " political scientists Brian F. Harrison and Melissa R. Michelson present a groundbreaking theory explaining how public opinion on same-sex marriage shifted from less than 10% support three decades ago to a majority stance today. Through meticulous experiments with professional sports fans, religious groups, and Black and Latino communities, the authors demonstrate that when influential figures from these diverse backgrounds publicly support LGBT rights, they catalyze significant attitude changes among their peers - even on issues seemingly unrelated to their core identity. This insightful study reveals that the most effective messages often come from unexpected sources, offering valuable lessons for advocates seeking to influence public opinion on contentious social issues.

While the LGBT community has made significant strides in North America, bisexual individuals still face decades of misinformation portraying them as indecisive, self-loathing, and untrustworthy.

The anthology examines how these individuals navigate through a culture dominated by monosexual norms, compulsory monogamy, and rigid gender expectations, offering a vision of bisexuality that extends beyond the traditional gay-straight binary.
