*Medieval Romance and the Politics of Cultural Fantasy*

<br>

In this groundbreaking work, Geraldine Heng traces the origins of medieval romance and the King Arthur legend to the bloody crucible of the First Crusade, where Christian knights committed unspeakable atrocities against Muslim foes in Syria. From these dark beginnings emerges a literary genre that would span nine centuries, as Heng demonstrates how fantasy served as a cultural laboratory for exploring identity, race, and religion in ways that continue to resonate today. Drawing on feminist theory and cultural studies, this ambitious book reveals how romance novels of the 12th through 15th centuries engaged with the seismic shifts of their time, from the shock of modernity to the expanding horizons of a globalized world. Through careful analysis of various romance subgenres and their key works, Heng shows how this ostensibly "escapist" genre has always been deeply entwined with the political and social ferment of its era, offering readers a fresh lens on the power of fantasy to reshape our understanding of history and culture.

*The Aesthetics of Possibility*

<br>

Widely heard and read throughout the Middle Ages, romance literature has persisted for centuries and re-emerged in speculative fiction, inviting readers to step out of the actual world and experience the intriguing pleasure of possibility. This interdisciplinary study examines the genre's deep philosophical underpinnings through Leibniz's "possible worlds" theory, Kant's aesthetic reflections, and Gadamer's writings on literary transmission. Analyzing six instances of medieval secular writing, including works by Marie de France, the Gawain-poet, and Chaucer, the authors demonstrate how these extravagantly imagined worlds invite reflection on the nature of reality itself.

*For My Lady's Heart and Shadowheart*

<br>

In this remarkable medieval romance series, New York Times-bestselling author Laura Kinsale weaves two unforgettable tales of love and adventure through the political machinations of 14th-century Europe. The first story follows a widowed princess who must navigate a web of alliances and personal desires, while the second centers on an ambitious pirate who stumbles into forbidden affection with his captive. Each novel unfolds in two distinct versions: one faithful to Middle English dialogue and historical detail, the other a more modern retelling that maintains the series' signature brilliance. Through it all, Kinsale proves herself a master of historical fiction, where no kingdom or heart remains untouched by the sweeping events that unfold.
