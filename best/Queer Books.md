*The Practice of Queer Oral History*

<br>

When written sources are scarce, historians often turn to oral histories for evidence - and no field relies on this method more than LGBTQ studies.

Through case studies ranging from 1940s San Francisco lesbian bars to 2000s Iraq War resistance, these researchers reveal how memory, desire, and identity shape our understanding of LGBTQ communities and cultures.

*Identities, Intimacies, and Ideology*

This concise sociological study examines how queer-identified individuals are shaping a distinct community through their intimate relationships and political ideologies.

The book traces the historical roots of queer activism and its resurgence in recent years, particularly through the lens of three black, queer women who founded the Black Lives Matter movement. Queer Community offers valuable insights into the ways this second wave of queer activism is transforming our understanding of sexual and gender identities in the face of persistent oppression.

Originally written in 1952 but not published until 1985, Queer is William S. Burroughs's haunting tale of possession and exorcism set in Mexico City. This short novel follows William Lee, the protagonist of Burroughs's debut novel Junky, as he struggles with heroin withdrawal and romantic yearnings for Eugene Allerton amidst the American expatriate scene. Both an unflinching autobiographical self-portrait and a coruscatingly political novel, Queer blends realistic depiction with Burroughsian fantasy, paving the way for his masterpiece Naked Lunch.
