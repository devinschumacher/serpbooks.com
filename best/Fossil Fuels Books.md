*Clearing the Air Before Cleaning the Air*

<br>

As fossil fuel supplies dwindle and environmental concerns mount, the global energy sector faces unprecedented challenges. Terry Etam's "The End of Fossil Fuel Insanity" cuts through media hype and scientific jargon to reveal the staggering scale of work required to transition away from petroleum-based energy. The book exposes the technical hurdles that make simply swapping out old technologies for new ones impossible, and calls for practical solutions that balance environmental needs with the realities of modern energy production.

*Why the Fossil Fuel Civilization Will Collapse by 2028, and the Bold Economic Plan to Save Life on Earth*

<br>

Renowned economic theorist Jeremy Rifkin presents "The Green New Deal, " a groundbreaking plan to transform the American economy and create a green post-fossil fuel culture. As the largest voting bloc, millennials are driving a national conversation around climate change, while key sectors of the economy decouple from fossil fuels in favor of cheaper solar and wind energies. Rifkin, with 25 years of experience implementing similar transitions for the European Union and China, provides the political narrative and economic framework needed to prevent runaway climate change and save life on Earth.

*Fossil Fuels, Thermodynamics, and the Politics of Work*

<br>

In "The Birth of Energy, " Cara New Daggett traces how modern energy concepts emerged from 19th-century thermodynamics, becoming entwined with industrial capitalism and work politics. She argues that tackling our current energy crisis requires transforming these foundational ideas rather than simply switching fuel sources, offering a profound reconsideration of how we understand and use energy today.

*Why Net Zero is Not Enough*

<br>

"Ending Fossil Fuels" by Holly Jean Buck contends that net-zero carbon emissions targets fall short of what's needed to combat the climate crisis. The book investigates the shortcomings of carbon capture technologies and makes a case for production-side solutions. Buck proposes a political strategy that unites rural and urban interests through platform governance to achieve fossil fuel industry nationalization. The book showcases how to repurpose the industry's assets to remove carbon from the atmosphere, providing a practical framework for climate policy that extends beyond emissions reduction goals.
