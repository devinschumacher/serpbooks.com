*The Unexpected Social and Economic Consequences for Women and Children in America*

<br>

Based on interviews with judges, lawyers, and divorced individuals in California, this sociological study examines the unintended social and economic consequences of divorce law reform for women and children. Lenore J. Weitzman concludes that while eliminating grounds, fault, and consent has reduced the acrimony of divorce proceedings, the adoption of gender-neutral standards for property awards and child support has led to increased economic hardship and social dislocation for divorced women and dependent children. The book presents a systematic analysis of California court data to support these findings and discusses the national implications of these legal changes.

*What Went Wrong?*

<br>

Since the 1970s, no-fault divorce statutes have swept across America, fundamentally altering how marriages end. Economist and lawyer Allen Parkman reveals that these legal changes have created significant financial hardships for many divorced women and children, arguing that the system fails to properly value human capital in divorce proceedings. Drawing from political science and legal theory, this important study critiques current divorce law and proposes reforms to address the injustices of no-fault divorce, suggesting that truly fair dissolution requires redefining the grounds for divorce to mutual consent.
