<br>

In the early 20th century, a pioneering female designer named Louise Brigham transformed America's approach to furniture through her innovative "box furniture" system. This sustainable design method, which utilized recycled materials to create sturdy, inexpensive furniture pieces, brought good design within reach of the urban working class. Brigham's work spanned carpentry workshops in New York and a company offering early ready-to-assemble furniture, making her a significant but largely forgotten figure in the history of sustainable design.

*Aspects of Medieval Authorship*

<br>

"In Search of the Culprit" challenges the traditional notion of authorship by examining how medieval and early modern literature were shaped through collaboration and textual transformation rather than individual genius. Drawing from English, German, and Scandinavian studies, this volume demonstrates that authorship should be understood as a narratological function that emerges from the interplay between text and context, rather than as a fixed attribute of literary works.
