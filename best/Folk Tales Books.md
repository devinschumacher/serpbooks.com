*Kentucky Mountain Folk Tales*

<br>

In the isolated Pine Mountain region of Kentucky, folklorist Leonard W. Roberts captured a vanishing tradition of English-language mountain tales three decades ago. This rich collection spans from mystical encounters with witches and giants to humorous Irishman jokes, preserving stories that were still part of the local culture at the time but have since been overshadowed by modern entertainment. The book not only entertains with old favorites like "Sleeping Beauty" and "The Golden Arm" retold in authentic mountain idiom, but also documents the cultural shift that occurred as television and technology infiltrated this remote area, threatening to erase centuries of oral tradition.
