![Mayas in the Marketplace | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/PiUD4l5VtSIC?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

*Tourism, Globalization, and Cultural Identity*

<br>

When Maya artisans from rural Guatemala bring their handicrafts to the international marketplace, they participate in a complex exchange that shapes both their products and their cultural identity. Drawing from over a decade of fieldwork, this ethnographic study examines how Kaqchikel Mayas who vend in Antigua's tourist market navigate the tensions between global demand and local tradition. The research reveals that far from homogenizing indigenous culture, this marketplace becomes a dynamic border zone where national and international, developed and underdeveloped, and indigenous and non-indigenous worlds intersect. Through their adaptations to meet tourist expectations, these vendors maintain a distinct Maya identity while contributing to the global recognition of Guatemalan handicrafts.

In this meticulously researched work, Katie Jarvis explores how Parisian market women, known as the Dames des Halles, transformed everyday commerce into a powerful political force during the French Revolution. Through their influential role in the capital's food market, these entrepreneurial women negotiated economic policies and social contracts that challenged traditional notions of citizenship, ultimately positioning useful work rather than gender as the cornerstone of civic legitimacy in the emerging democratic landscape.

*Adwoman Jean Wade Rindlaub and the Selling of America*

<br>

In this meticulously researched biography, Ellen Wayland-Smith chronicles the advertising career of Jean Wade Rindlaub, a woman who rose to prominence in the 1950s by crafting mega-sales generating campaigns for brands like Oneida silverware and Betty Crocker cake mix. Unlike her fictional counterpart Peggy Olson, Rindlaub embraced traditional gender roles while revolutionizing the way advertisers sold domestic products. Through her work, we see how postwar American culture came to equate free enterprise with moral virtue, a narrative that would shape women's economic and emotional lives for decades to come.
