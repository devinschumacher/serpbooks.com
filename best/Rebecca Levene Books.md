In this National Book Critics Circle Award-winning collection, Rebecca Solnit delivers six razor-sharp essays that dissect the pervasive problem of "mansplaining" and its impact on women's voices in public discourse. Through personal anecdotes and cultural commentary, Solnit explores how men often assume authority over women's experiences and knowledge, leading to everything from awkward social interactions to dangerous oversights in emergency situations. The essays range from a comic take on not knowing to a sobering examination of violence against women, each piece masterfully weaving together humor and incisive social critique.
