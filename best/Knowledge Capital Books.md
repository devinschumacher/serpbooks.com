*Education and the Economics of Growth*

<br>

In this groundbreaking work, economists Eric Hanushek and Ludger Woessmann present a rigorous analysis demonstrating that a nation's cognitive skills, or "knowledge capital, " are the primary driver of long-term economic growth. Drawing from international student assessments and empirical data, the authors argue that traditional proxies for human capital development, such as years of schooling, fail to capture the essential relationship between valued skills and prosperity. Through robust econometric tests and case studies of regional economic phenomena, including the Latin American growth puzzle and the East Asian miracle, Hanushek and Woessmann establish that cognitive skills are the key determinant of a country's development trajectory. The book concludes with policy recommendations for education systems that foster accountability, competition, and performance-based rewards to develop the knowledge capital essential for sustained economic growth.
