*Contemporary Art in Theory, Practice, and Instruction*

Since the rise of Conceptual Art, critics and artists have focused on exposing power dynamics through cultural critique.

"Beyond Critique" examines these developments, featuring contributions from artists, critics, curators, and historians who offer new criteria for contemporary art and its pedagogy. The book considers various methods beyond traditional critique, including the role of affect, intimacy, and spirituality in artistic practice.
