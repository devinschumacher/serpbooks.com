*How blogs, MySpace, YouTube, and the rest of today's user-generated media are destroying our economy, our culture, and our values*

In this provocative Silicon Valley insider's report, Andrew Keen sounds the alarm on Web 2.0's dark side, where amateur content threatens to upend professional media and creative industries. As blogs, MySpace, and YouTube reshape our cultural landscape, Keen reveals how this new participatory web is siphoning advertising revenue, fueling digital piracy, and blurring the lines between expert and amateur. Drawing from over 200 years of copyright protection, he warns that our most valued cultural institutions are under siege from free, user-generated content that threatens to undermine the very foundation of American creativity. Offering concrete solutions to rein in the web's free-wheeling culture, "The Cult of the Amateur" serves as a clarion call to rethink our relationship with the digital revolution that's transforming entertainment, journalism, and artistry.
