*Education, Nationalism, and Print Culture*

<br>

The late nineteenth century witnessed a cultural revolution in Iran, marked by the emergence of new institutions dedicated to producing and disseminating national history. Farzin Vejdani's work explores how this transformation synthesized previously fragmented historical narratives and dynastic chronicles, drawing from previously unexamined primary sources such as school curricula and periodicals. The research highlights the impact of state-intellectual interactions, particularly among feminists and poets, on historical interpretation. As a centralized Iranian state took shape in the early twentieth century, competing historical visions converged, fundamentally reshaping Iran's understanding of its past and national identity.
