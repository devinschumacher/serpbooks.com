Before it became Tokyo, the vibrant capital of modern Japan, this strategic city spent nearly three centuries as Edo, the political and cultural hub of the Tokugawa shogunate. From its origins in 1590 to the dawn of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Edo evolved from a modest military outpost to a sophisticated urban center that rivaled any city of its time. Through meticulous research and stunning illustrations, this book reveals the architectural marvels and social institutions that defined Edo, including its iconic bridge, the imposing Shogun's castle, and the flourishing arts scene that gave birth to kabuki theater and the Yoshiwara district.
