*Print Culture, Censorship, and Modernity in Twentieth-Century America*

Until the close of the Second Vatican Council in 1965, the Roman Catholic Church maintained a staunchly anti-modern stance, viewing developments in culture, economics, and social norms through a skeptical lens.

Cush presents theology not just as an academic pursuit but as a lived encounter with the divine, grounded in the rich tradition of the Catholic Church.
