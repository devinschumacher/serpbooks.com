When Maggie witnesses impossible things and her family dismisses her claims, they send her to spend the winter in a remote farmhouse upstate. Bored and angry, she starts playing tricks with her sister Kate, but their pranks take an unexpected turn when the house itself begins to make mysterious sounds. Inspired by the true story of the Fox Sisters who made their fortune in 19th-century America by communicating with ghosts, "We Played With Fire" weaves a tale of two young girls who uncover something extraordinary in the dead of winter.

This embedded practice challenges conventional views of barter as mere commodity exchange, instead revealing it as a profound economic and social ritual that helps recreate community bonds through value creation.
