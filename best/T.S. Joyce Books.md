*A Synchronic Dialogue of Texts*

<br>

This scholarly work examines how James Joyce's writing was influenced by early psychoanalytic texts available to him before the publication of Ulysses in 1922. Through close readings of three key psychoanalytic works Joyce purchased in Trieste and his extensive use of psychoanalytic literature in Zurich, Jean Kimball draws parallels between these texts and Joyce's artistic vision. The study reveals how Joyce incorporated psychoanalytic concepts into his writing, particularly in Ulysses, where textual parallels and verbal echoes of early psychoanalytic writings can be found throughout the novel.
