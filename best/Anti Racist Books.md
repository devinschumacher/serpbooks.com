*The Problem with Middle-Class White Anti-Racism*

In "Good White People, " Shannon Sullivan critiques the prevailing middle-class white anti-racism that prioritizes personal virtue over systemic change.

She argues for a transformative ethos that acknowledges and acts upon white privilege rather than seeking self-righteous distance from it.

*Anti/Racist Campus Rhetorics*

*An Introduction to Activism and Action*

<br>

In this powerful pocket-sized guide, Sophie Williams - the influential voice behind @officialmillennialblack - transforms casual observers into active anti-racist allies. Going beyond theoretical concepts, this carefully curated collection of practical steps demonstrates why not being racist is only the beginning of the journey toward true equality. As the tragic murder of George Floyd and the subsequent Black Lives Matter movement have shown, systemic change requires courage, self-reflection, and a willingness to embrace discomfort. Through her insightful lens, Williams weaves together comprehensive strategies to combat not just racism, but the interconnected web of oppression that affects us all.
