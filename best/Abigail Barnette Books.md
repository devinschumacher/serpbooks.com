*The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters*

In this groundbreaking work, Wall Street Journal writer Abigail Shrier exposes a shocking trend sweeping through schools across America: once-rare gender dysphoria is now affecting entire groups of female friends, from college students to middle schoolers. Drawing from hundreds of interviews with girls, parents, and medical professionals, Shrier reveals how well-meaning assemblies and social media influencers are pushing young women towards life-altering decisions, including double mastectomies and puberty blockers that can cause permanent infertility. As cases of "irreversible damage" mount, this timely book offers parents urgently needed guidance on protecting their daughters from a movement that threatens to change their lives.
