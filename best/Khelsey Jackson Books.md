*Britain in the Enlightenment*

<br>

In this meticulously researched work, Michael Hunter challenges the conventional narrative that science alone dismantled magical thinking in Enlightenment Britain. Instead, he argues that freethinkers and humanists led the charge against supernatural beliefs, drawing from classical authors to critique religion and magic. As confidence in a stable, rational world grew, magic gradually lost its hold on both educated and ordinary people, marking a profound shift in British intellectual and cultural history.

This groundbreaking study challenges traditional accounts of the Scottish Enlightenment by examining the period between 1680 and 1745 as a 'First' Scottish Enlightenment.
