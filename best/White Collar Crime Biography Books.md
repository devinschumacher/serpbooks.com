<br>

"Crime, Shame and Reintegration" introduces a pioneering criminological theory that questions traditional views on crime and punishment. John Braithwaite synthesizes research from multiple societies to demonstrate that shaming's effectiveness as a deterrent hinges on cultural context. When applied with respect for individual dignity, shaming proves to be a powerful tool for social control; however, punitive use typically fails, instead fueling criminal behavior. The book's insights carry significant implications for legal and social policy, advocating for criminal justice systems grounded in moral principles rather than retribution.
