*The Making of America's First Spymaster*

<br>

In this meticulously researched work, historian John A. Nagy reveals the untold story of George Washington's espionage activities during the American Revolution. Drawing from Washington's own diary and supported by hundreds of previously undocumented spies, this book demonstrates how the future president transformed a disorganized colonial force into a disciplined army capable of defeating the British. Nagy shows how Washington's experiences in the French and Indian War laid the foundation for his masterful use of intelligence operations, which he then applied with devastating effectiveness during the Revolutionary War. Through carefully selected anecdotes and strategic insights, this book illustrates why espionage became a decisive factor in the struggle for American independence and how Washington's leadership in this covert domain contributed directly to the nation's founding.
