*Kit Carson, John C. Fremont and the Claiming of the American West*

<br>

A Newer World by David Roberts chronicles the remarkable journeys of John C. Frémont and Kit Carson through the untamed American West of the 1840s and 1850s. Frémont, a political and military leader, led five expeditions that would forever change the landscape of the region, while Carson, his skilled scout, saved him from certain death on multiple occasions. Their partnership, forged in the face of unimaginable hardships, helped precipitate the Mexican-American War and secured California for the United States. Drawing from previously unpublished sources and personal expeditions retracing the explorers' steps, Roberts masterfully weaves together the story of two men who, despite their differences, became close friends amidst their shared experiences. The book stands as a significant contribution to the literature of American exploration, highlighting the complex relationship between progress and the tragic impact on Native American communities.
