In "Understanding Dogs, " sociologist Clinton R. Sanders explores the complex relationships between humans and their canine companions. Drawing from a decade of ethnographic research in veterinary offices, guide dog schools, and obedience classes, the book examines how people come to know their dogs as thinking, emotional beings.

Through detailed accounts of guide dog training, veterinary care, and personal anecdotes, the book links animal companionship to both social and personal identity. From nineteenth-century pet ownership among the poor to Bill Clinton's beloved labrador Buddy, Sanders demonstrates how dogs serve not only as social facilitators but as meaningful companions that shape our understanding of what it means to be human.
