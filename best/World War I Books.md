## [ADOLF HITLER BOLSHEVIK AND ZIONIST Volume III World War I](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/ADOLF+HITLER+BOLSHEVIK+AND+ZIONIST+Volume+III+World+War+I?i=stripbooks)

<br>

World War I changed the course of human history, toppling empires and giving rise to new political movements that would shape the 20th century. This book examines the war's most significant consequences, from the Balfour Declaration granting Palestine to Jewry, to the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, and Hitler's emergence as a National Socialist leader in Germany. Through the lens of key historical figures including Woodrow Wilson and the European monarchs, the author illustrates how the "war to end all wars" instead paved the way for even greater conflicts, including the Second World War. The book also explores the war's economic legacy, showing how stock market capitalism and the Federal Reserve system emerged in response to the war's financial demands, ultimately leading to the Great Depression and fueling socialist and communist movements worldwide.
