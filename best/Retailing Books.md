*Pop-up Stores in a Postmodern Consumption Era*

"Ephemeral Retailing" by Ghalia Boustani explores the rise of pop-up stores as a dynamic new retail format. These temporary spaces, which can appear and disappear without notice, offer brands a unique opportunity to engage with consumers through surprise and novelty. The 116-page book examines how these stores differ from traditional and online retail models, and why they're becoming an essential part of modern distribution channels.
