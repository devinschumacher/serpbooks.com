<br>

In this insightful work, Derek Bouse examines how wildlife films have evolved from early animal locomotion studies to become a powerful medium shaping public understanding of nature. Tracing the genre's development through seminal works and key milestones, the book reveals how these films construct idealized portrayals of animal life that often diverge from scientific reality. Bouse argues that by projecting human values and social structures onto animals, these popular works not only misrepresent nature but reinforce the misconception that human norms derive from natural law.
