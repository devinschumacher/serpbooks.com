This modern textbook presents classical mechanics through the lens of Newton's, Lagrange's, and Hamilton's equations, highlighting the connections and distinctions between these fundamental approaches. The book systematically explores oscillatory motion, fluid dynamics, and electromagnetism, culminating in a rigorous treatment of Einstein's special and general theories of relativity. Mathematical rigor is balanced with clear physical intuition, supported by numerous practice problems that reinforce the material's key concepts.
