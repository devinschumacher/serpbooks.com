<br>

In this MIT Press publication, Tiqqun presents a profound critique of cybernetics as a foundational technology of late capitalism. The text examines how cybernetic systems, designed to combat entropy and maintain order, have instead created new forms of disinformation and control. The authors argue that these technological developments represent a pivotal moment in history where the lines between human and machine, public and private, begin to dissolve. Through rigorous analysis and speculative futurism, "The Cybernetic Hypothesis" offers both a genealogy of our current technological landscape and a tactical framework for resistance against its most deleterious effects.

*The Hollowing of Western Democracy*

<br>

In this prescient work, political scientist Peter Mair argues that Western democracy is facing a legitimacy crisis as major parties become increasingly disconnected from the electorate. Published originally in 2013, "Ruling the Void" anticipated the rise of populist movements by examining how Europe's political elites had transformed themselves into a homogeneous professional class, withdrawing into state institutions amid growing public frustration. Mair's analysis extends beyond Britain and the EU to consider the broader implications for democratic representation in the developed world, highlighting the proliferation of non-democratic agencies and practices that threaten to hollow out traditional democratic structures.
