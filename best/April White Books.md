*How Women Revolutionized Marriage and Found Freedom on the American Frontier*

<br>

In the late 1800s, five railroad lines converged on Sioux Falls, South Dakota, carrying passengers to the heart of a national debate over marriage and divorce. As the country's most lenient divorce laws drew societal divorcees to this frontier town, four distinctive women navigated the dramatic legal and social upheaval that would reshape American attitudes toward marital freedom. Among them were Maggie De Stuers, a New York Astor descendent whose divorce captivated headlines; Mary Nevins Blaine, who battled her mother-in-law in the public eye; Blanche Molineux, an actress fleeing a murderous husband; and Flora Bigelow Dodge, relentless in her pursuit of a "dignified" divorce. Through meticulously researched court documents and newspaper archives, historian April White weaves an intimate narrative of these pioneering women who transformed personal struggles into national conversation about the future of American marriage.
