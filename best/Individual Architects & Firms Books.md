![A Dreambook for Our Time | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/wazqAAAAMAAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

In this profound Polish novel, a young man emerges from a near-death experience to find himself in a world that mirrors his inner turmoil. As he navigates through flashbacks of his wartime experiences and the surreal present, he's surrounded by villagers who've created their own private religion in response to their desperate circumstances. Between episodes of intense dialogue and poetic descriptions, the narrator grapples with the absurdity of existence and the impossibility of finding meaning in a godless universe. His journey becomes a powerful metaphor for the human condition in the decades following World War II, as he oscillates between a desperate need for punishment and a longing for peace that threatens to consume him.
