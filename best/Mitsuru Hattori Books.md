*The Ghost Dance Religion and the Making of Modern America*

<br>

In 1890, a new religion swept through Indian reservations across the American West, its followers dancing in circles until they collapsed into trances. When the US Army attempted to suppress this movement, over two hundred Lakota Sioux were killed at Wounded Knee Creek. "God's Red Son" by Louis Warren offers a groundbreaking re-examination of the Ghost Dance religion, tracing its origins from the visions of a Northern Paiute named Wovoka to its tragic conclusion at Wounded Knee. Contrary to popular belief, Warren reveals that Ghost Dance followers were not resistant to modernity but sought to thrive in it, advocating for wage work, farming, and education - principles that helped the religion endure for decades after the tragedy at Wounded Knee. This meticulously researched account shines a light on how Ghost Dance teachings enabled Native Americans to retain their cultural identity while navigating the complexities of modern American life.
