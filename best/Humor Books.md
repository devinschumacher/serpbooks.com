*Using Humor to Reverse-engineer the Mind*

<br>

Why do we find some things inherently funny, while others leave us completely baffled? In their groundbreaking work, "Inside Jokes: Using Humor to Reverse-Engineer the Mind, " cognitive scientists Matthew Hurley, Daniel Dennett, and Reginald Adams reveal the evolutionary roots of humor, tracing how our ancestors' need to process complex information gave rise to this unique mental faculty. Through a lens that spans from Charlie Chaplin's silent films to contemporary neuroscience, they show how humor evolved as a biological mechanism to reward our brains for solving the computational challenges of social interaction and environmental navigation. This MIT Press volume not only explains why humor exists but also demonstrates how it continues to shape our cognitive development and social bonds.
