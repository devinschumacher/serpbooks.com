When the University of Kentucky faced stagnation in 1917, a special committee called for transformative changes, leading to the appointment of President Frank L. McVey. Over the next two decades, McVey worked tirelessly to establish Kentucky as a leading institution of higher learning, recruiting exceptional faculty, expanding graduate programs, and promoting research. Despite challenges including the antievolution controversy and the Great Depression, McVey's vision transformed the university from a small state college into the commonwealth's flagship institution, leaving an enduring legacy in both university administration and educational reform.
