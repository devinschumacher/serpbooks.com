<br>

Emotions in Late Modernity explores how individualized, reflexive thinking has transformed our emotional experiences and expressions. This international collection challenges conventional wisdom on emotions, demonstrating increased complexity in how we process and act on our feelings. The book examines tensions between collective and individual emotions, from courtroom dramas to classroom interactions, and contrasts historical emotional mediation with contemporary digital influences. Through case studies on fear politics and climate change, the authors illustrate both micro and macro management of emotions in today's complex world.
