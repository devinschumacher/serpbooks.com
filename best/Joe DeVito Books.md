*Gaian Environmentalism in Daikaiju Cinema*

<br>

In the 2010s, American cinema witnessed the return of science fiction's most iconic adversaries, King Kong and Godzilla, as environmental protectors of a troubled Earth. Their 2021 confrontation resolved Toho's 1963 classic, showcasing these titanic creatures as naturalistic defenders of a "living Earth" Gaia, threatened by mankind's hubris and prehistoric foes. Through Carl Sagan's "dream dragons" analogy, this 259-page exploration examines the environmental significance of Kong and Godzilla, comparing Legendary and Joe DeVito's portrayals while highlighting their shared prehistory.
