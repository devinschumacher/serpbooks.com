*The Hidden Power in Global Capital Markets*

<br>

"Darkness by Design" is a comprehensive exposé of the global capital market's evolution over the past two decades. Princeton University Press published this work in 2019, authored by Walter Mattli. The book examines how algorithmic high-speed trading has displaced traditional floor trading and market makers, leading to increased market fragmentation and the rise of "dark" markets. Mattli traces the decline of the NYSE's central role in capital markets and the regulatory challenges that have emerged as trading has moved online. The author argues that power politics now dominate fragmented markets, creating new winners and losers while undermining transparency and oversight. Essential reading for investors and economists, this book reveals the troubling implications of unchecked market power for the global economy and society.
