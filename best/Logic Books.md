*A Paradox Logic*

<br>

"Diamond: A Paradox Logic" introduces a revolutionary mathematical framework where statements can simultaneously be true and false, existing in an "imaginary" state between being and non-being. This system resolves famous paradoxes of mathematical logic through its unique three-valued approach, bridging the gap between traditional boolean logic and the complexities of higher mathematics. The book explores both elementary and advanced applications of this new logic, from resolving Russell's and Cantor's paradoxes to its implications for Godelian meta-mathematics and beyond.

While logical principles may seem timeless and universal, their discovery is actually a story of personal accidents, political tragedies, and broad social change. "If A, Then B" tracks the expansion of logic from its emergence twenty-three centuries ago to its foundational role in modern mathematics and computer science. Through the turbulent times of thinkers like Aristotle and Alan Turing, this philosophical history reveals how social forces shape our understanding of logic, making abstract principlesrelevant to real-world events and human experiences.

<br>

This volume examines the limitations of mathematical logic and proposes a new approach to logic intended to overcome them. By comparing mathematical logic with earlier views of logic from Plato to Kant, the author identifies a fundamental limitation of mathematical logic: its confinement to deductive reasoning, which narrows its scope and impact on scientific practice. To address this, the book formulates non-deductive rules of discovery, such as induction and analogy, positioning logic as a tool for hypothesis generation rather than mere validation. This shift leads to a reevaluation of logic's relationship with evolution, language, and mathematical knowledge, aiming toreopen doors closed by the founders of mathematical logic.

In this challenging and provocative analysis, Dale Jacquette argues that contemporary philosophy perpetuates several historically inherited misconceptions about the nature of logic and its philosophical implications. By critically examining fundamental aspects of formal symbolic logic and their relation to thought, language, and reality, Jacquette exposes significant flaws in conventional logical theory and offers a novel framework for understanding traditional logic within the broader context of modern logical developments. His rigorous examination spans key areas including truth functionality, the metaphysics of reference and predication, and the role of truth in meaning theory, ultimately reshaping the philosophical landscape of logic as we know it.

Pure inductive logic explores rational probability as a branch of mathematical logic, presenting key results from the past seventy years within a unified framework. The monograph covers traditional rationality concepts like avoiding Dutch Books and respecting symmetry, while also delving into emerging areas such as polyadic languages and language invariance. This comprehensive account serves as both a self-contained course for mathematically grounded logicians and a valuable reference for philosophers and computer scientists interested in the foundations of rational probability.
