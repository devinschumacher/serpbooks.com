*Teacher Education and Professionalization in American Culture*

<br>

Through careful examination of teacher education's evolution from the 1830s to the 1920s, Jurgen Herbst reveals the systemic shift that transformed public school teaching from a respected profession to a marginalized field. As graduate schools of education emerged, they redirected focus from elementary school teacher training to producing educational specialists, neglecting the very teachers who form the backbone of our public school system. Herbst's work serves as both historical documentation of this pivotal period and a clarion call for modern reform, emphasizing that genuine professionalization of teachers is essential for meaningful educational improvement.

*Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money*

<br>

In this provocative work, economist Bryan Caplan challenges the conventional wisdom that education is a passport to personal and professional success. Drawing from decades of economic research, Caplan argues that the primary value of education lies not in skill development but in signaling to employers the qualities of a good employee. The book systematically examines why students forget most of what they learn, why increased education spending hasn't translated to better jobs for average workers, and how employers often reward costly schooling that goes unused on the job. Caplan makes a compelling case for why cutting education spending could be the most practical solution to these systemic issues, offering a fresh perspective on one of society's most sacred institutions.
