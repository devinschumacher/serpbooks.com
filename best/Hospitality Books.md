<br>

In "God, Gender and the Bible, " Deborah Sawyer examines how biblical writers used gender as a theological strategy to elevate the divine, often through female characters that undermine human masculinity. By analyzing key texts from both Hebrew and Christian scripture, Sawyer demonstrates that both maleness and femaleness are constructs in light of divine omnipotence. This study avoids hegemonist interpretations common in Christian and Jewish traditions, instead embracing the inconsistencies inherent in biblical literature to offer a fresh perspective on the relationship between gender and power in religious contexts.
