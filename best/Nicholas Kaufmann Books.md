*Frank Lloyd Wright, E. J. Kaufmann, and America's Most Extraordinary House*

<br>

Fallingwater Rising tells the remarkable story of how Frank Lloyd Wright's most famous house came to be built over a Pennsylvania waterfall in 1937. When Wright, nearing seventy and out of work during the Depression, received the commission from Pittsburgh department-store mogul E. J. Kaufmann, it kicked off an unlikely collaboration between the brilliant modernist architect and the man who would become his most important patron. Together, they created an architectural masterpiece that would confirm Wright's legacy while providing Kaufmann with the world-famous home he'd always dreamed of. The book also explores the personal dramas that unfolded within the house's walls, involving Kaufmann's beautiful cousin/wife Liliane and their son Edgar Jr. , whose own contributions to Fallingwater's creation and preservation would later become crucial. Through meticulous research and attention to historical detail, Franklin Toker weaves a narrative that extends from the dusty architectural offices of 1930s Pittsburgh to the international recognition that would eventually befall this groundbreaking work of modern architecture.
