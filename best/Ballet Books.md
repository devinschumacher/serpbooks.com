*Modernism Before and Beyond Balanchine*

<br>

When George Balanchine arrived in the United States in 1933, he introduced a neoclassical ballet vision that would become the first American incarnation of the art form. This meticulously researched study challenges the prevailing belief that Balanchine alone reshaped ballet history, instead highlighting the intricate social, cultural, and political influences that molded American neoclassical ballet. Through rigorous analysis of the era's significant choreographic works and cultural shifts, the study demonstrates that ballet's modernist transformation during this tumultuous period resulted from multiple factors. These included the increasing prominence of classical dance in American society and the broader debate about modern art's role within both American and global cultural contexts.

*A Soviet-American Exchange*

<br>

In 1959, the Bolshoi Ballet embarked on its inaugural US tour, kicking off a Cold War cultural exchange that would see three major ballet companies perform in both the Soviet Union and the United States between 1959 and 1962. This meticulously researched book examines how Soviet and American audiences interpreted each other's ballet through the lens of their own aesthetics, revealing that the perceived differences between Soviet and American ballet stem more from viewer expectations than from the performances themselves. Drawing from both Russian and English archival sources, Anne Searcy demonstrates the profound impact these tours had on shaping twentieth-century ballet, as political leaders including Khrushchev and Kennedy witnessed firsthand the powerful connection between dance and diplomacy.
