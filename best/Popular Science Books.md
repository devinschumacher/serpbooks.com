*Fossils and the Poetics of Popular Science, 1802-1856*

<br>

At the dawn of the nineteenth century, geology stood as a contentious outlier to the established narrative of Creation, its empirical claims met with skepticism and dismissal. Yet within fifty years, this fledgling science had undergone a remarkable transformation, emerging as the celebrated cornerstone of Victorian scientific thought. Ralph O'Connor chronicles this pivotal evolution, illustrating how a cadre of innovative science communicators repackaged complex geological concepts into captivating stories that resonated with a broad audience. Through masterful storytelling and visual spectacle, these early geologists presented an alternative. history of the Earth that was far more compelling than the conventional six days of Creation. O'Connor's work illuminatesthe strategic borrowing of literary techniques from poetry and entertainment that proved instrumental in establishing geology's scientific authority, offering an intimate window into how scientific knowledge is shaped and disseminated through cultural frameworks.

![The People's Peking Man | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/d10bJBvgjLkC?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

*Popular Science and Human Identity in Twentieth-Century China*

<br>

In the 1920s, an international team of scientists and miners unearthed the richest evidence of human evolution the world had ever seen: Peking Man. After the communist revolution of 1949, this fossil became a prominent figure in China's movement to bring science to the people. In a new state with twin goals of crushing "superstition" and establishing a socialist society, the story of human evolution was the first lesson in Marxist philosophy offered to the masses. However, even Mao's commitment to mass participation in science couldn't account for how legends about the Bigfoot-like Wild Man were reshaping ideas about human nature. This book skillfully weaves together the scientific discovery of Peking Man with the cultural and political debates that surrounded it, offering an innovative approach to modern Chinese history and the history of science.

*Evangelical Popular Science Publishing in Victorian Britain*

<br>

In Victorian Britain, the Religious Tract Society responded to the growing separation of science and faith by publishing a series of popular science books during the 1840s. These works employed evangelical techniques such as low prices and simple language to counter the notion that science and religion were mutually exclusive, making them one of the most widely available sources of scientific information in the era. Through the examination of relatively undistinguished authors who used Christian rhetoric to educate and convert readers, "Science and Salvation" offers a fresh perspective on the relationship between science and religion in evangelical publishing.
