<br>

Our "wireless" world often obscures the undersea cable systems that transmit nearly all transoceanic Internet traffic. Nicole Starosielski's "The Undersea Network" illuminates these vital infrastructures, charting their course from ocean depths to South Pacific shores. Her work synthesizes extensive research with a digital mapping project to illustrate how these cables connect disparate cultures, histories, and environments worldwide.
