*The Legacy of Film Noir in Contemporary American Cinema*

<br>

Classic film noir emerged as Hollywood's 'dark cinema' in the 1940s and 1950s, offering a bleak counterpoint to the American Dream through its portrayal of crime and corruption. This genre evolved dramatically after its supposed demise in the late 1950s, with contemporary neo-noir films like Chinatown and Reservoir Dogs reinterpreting the original style for modern audiences. "Mean Streets and Raging Bulls" examines this transformation, showcasing how filmmakers from Polanski to Tarantino have maintained the noir tradition while pushing it in new directions.
