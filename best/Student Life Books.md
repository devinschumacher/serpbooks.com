In this meticulously researched work, historian Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz traces the evolution of American college life from the post-revolutionary period to the 20th century. By examining student behavior, club culture, athletics, and campus politics, she identifies three distinct sub-cultures that have shaped undergraduate experiences across generations: the traditional "College Men" who embraced the social and competitive aspects of campus life, the "Outsiders" who focused on academic and professional preparation, and the "Rebels" who challenged the status quo through collective action. The book highlights how external pressures and societal changes influenced these sub-cultures, leading to the emergence of a new generation of highly career-oriented students in the 1970s. Through careful analysis of primary sources and historical data, Horowitz provides valuable insights into the enduring patterns of student life and the factors that continue to shape campus culture.
