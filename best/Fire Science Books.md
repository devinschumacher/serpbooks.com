## [The Benefits of Behavioral Research to the Fire Service](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/The+Benefits+of+Behavioral+Research+to+the+Fire+Service?i=stripbooks)

![The Benefits of Behavioral Research to the Fire Service | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/d--PG-BOKEMC?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

*Human Behavior in Fires and Emergencies*

<br>

Traditionally, fire safety engineering assumed that people would evacuate immediately upon hearing a fire alarm, with evacuation times largely determined by physical abilities and exit proximity. However, behavioral research reveals that two-thirds of evacuation time is actually spent in "startup" activities - milling about and seeking information - before occupants even begin moving toward exits. This groundbreaking work has profound implications for building design, as author Peter W. Blaich argues that human-centered design must provide occupants with the necessary information to adapt to the chaos and uncertainty of fire development.
