<br>

The Maliniak Method presents a groundbreaking theory that hair loss and male pattern baldness result from two interconnected factors: the tightness of the scalp's galea, which restricts blood flow to hair follicles, and the subsequent accumulation of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which damages these follicles. This innovative approach also reveals that dormant follicles can be revived through a combination of scalp massage techniques and electrical stimulation, drawing from Nikola Tesla's century-old scientific principles. Supported by independent studies from the Crown institute and University of Pennsylvania, this 54-page guide offers a simplified two-step treatment that could reshape our understanding of hair loss prevention and reversal.
