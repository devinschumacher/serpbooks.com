From 1939 to 1960, Ernest Hemingway made Cuba his home, and this literary journey explores the profound impact the country had on his life and work.

The book draws from exclusive research at Finca Vigia, Hemingway's home in Cuba, where curators have preserved a trove of his letters, books, and personal documents that continue to influence Hemingway scholarship.
