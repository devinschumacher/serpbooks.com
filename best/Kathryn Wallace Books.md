<br>

Cover Name: Dr. Rantzau offers a rare insider's look at German espionage during World War II through the personal experiences of Colonel Nikolaus Ritter. After serving briefly in World War I and spending ten years as a businessman in America, Ritter returned to Germany in 1935 to lead Air Intelligence for the Abwehr. This position gave him access to some of the war's most closely guarded secrets, including the Norden bombsight and Sperry gyroscope, which he successfully smuggled into Germany. The memoir details his work establishing an extensive network of agents across Europe and his involvement in planning the invasion of the British Isles. Captured by the British in 1945, Ritter dictated this account from his prison cell, providing historians with one of the few firsthand accounts of the Abwehr's inner workings and its extensive agent network.
