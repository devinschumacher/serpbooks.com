*The History of Aerospace Engineering at Purdue University*

<br>

Purdue University has been a powerhouse in aerospace engineering since the 1940s, producing 6% of all BS degrees and 7% of all PhDs in the field over the past 65 years. This corrected and expanded second edition chronicles the school's most significant contributions to aviation and space exploration, including the work of Purdue graduates on every US manned space flight from the first to the last moon landing. The story unfolds through three generations of aerospace pioneers who've led major corporations and government agencies, establishing an unparalleled legacy in both research and exploration.
