In the small coal-mining town of Hoadley, Pennsylvania, a disfigured woman returns to wreak vengeance on the people who tormented her. Her arrival sets off a series of eerie events: cicadas swarm the streets bearing children's faces, a blacksnake slithers next to the most beautiful naked man anyone has seen, and four women ride horses through town, unaware they are the Four Horsewomen of doom. As a familiar stranger walks into town with a terrible purpose, the inhabitants of this struggling community realize that Judgment Day is nigh. Through allegory and symbolism, "Apocalypse" explores themes of small-town prejudice and the power of love to triumph against all odds.
