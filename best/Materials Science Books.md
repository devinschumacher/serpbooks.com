The Coming of Materials Science charts the evolution of materials science as a distinct academic and industrial discipline. Professor Robert Cahn examines the emergence of key scientific concepts, from atomic theory to thermodynamics, and explores how neighboring fields have influenced materials science's development. Through critical analysis of the discipline's historical trajectory, Cahn raises fundamental questions about scientific practice: What defines a scientific discipline? How do disciplines merge and differentiate? Can a discipline be inherently interdisciplinary? Is materials science a cohesive field? The book integrates early foundational research with contemporary developments, inviting readers to engage critically with these ideas and consider alternative perspectives on the discipline's future.
