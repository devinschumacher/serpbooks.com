*A True Story About Schizophrenia*

When Sandy Allen's uncle Bob mails her his sixty-page autobiography, it kicks off an extraordinary literary journey. Typewritten in all caps and riddled with errors, Bob's manuscript offers an unfiltered look at his life as a "psychotic paranoid schizophrenic" who grew up in 1960s and 1970s Berkeley. As Sandy works to translate her uncle's raw words into a coherent story, she uncovers a powerful narrative of a young man battling for stability in both his life and his mind. Their collaborative effort produces a heartbreaking and sometimes humorous portrait that challenges everything readers think they know about schizophrenia and mental illness.

*Technologies of the Soul in the Age of Artificial Intelligence*

<br>

In this insightful work, Mark Coeckelbergh traces the evolution of self-improvement culture from its philosophical roots to its current incarnation in the age of artificial intelligence. Critically examining the role of technology in shaping modern notions of personal development, the author reveals how our relentless pursuit of self-perfection has paradoxically led to increased anxiety and disconnection. Rather than offering quick fixes or ancient wisdom repackaged as self-help memes, Coeckelbergh proposes a radical rethinking of both our concept of the self and our approach to social change, advocating for "narrative technologies" that empower us to construct more authentic and fulfilling stories about ourselves and our place in the world.
