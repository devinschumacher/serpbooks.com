From his privileged youth in British-ruled India to his meteoric rise as Pakistan's youngest Cabinet member at just thirty years old, this meticulously researched biography charts Zulfi Bhutto's extraordinary journey through the highest echelons of Pakistani politics.

Wolpert reveals, Bhutto's story is inseparable from the turbulent founding and early struggles of Pakistan itself - a nation born out of division with India and later wracked by its own internal conflicts leading to the creation of Bangladesh. This scholarly yet engaging portrait follows the charismatic politician as he builds his legacy, founding his own political movement and ultimately assuming leadership of a country forever changed by his ambitions and actions.

*An Intimate History of Pakistan*

<br>

Through the intimate lens of her own family's experiences, Rafia Zakaria weaves together the larger narrative of Pakistan's evolution from a promising nation to one grappling with terrorism and religious extremism. Her story begins in 1962 when her Muslim-Indian family immigrates to Karachi, seeing it as a land of opportunity after the Partition. However, their hopes begin to dim in the 1980s as military dictators impose draconian laws that particularly impact women's rights. When Zakaria's uncle Sohail takes a second wife, it triggers a personal crisis that mirrors the broader turmoil unfolding in their adopted country. As Benazir Bhutto's assassination brings Pakistan to a standstill, Zakaria uses this pivotal moment to explore how her family's struggles reflect the precarious balance between tradition and modernity that defines Pakistan's complex history.
