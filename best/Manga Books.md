![Comics and the Origins of Manga | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/5Hw-EAAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

*A Revisionist History*

<br>

This academic work challenges conventional wisdom by tracing Japanese manga's origins back to the 1920s and 1930s, when Western comics were enthusiastically adopted in Japan. Eike Exner's meticulous research shows that manga's rise coincided with Japan embracing new visual storytelling techniques from the United States. As American characters like Jiggs and Maggie, the Katzenjammer Kids, Felix the Cat, and Popeye became immensely popular in Japan, their legacy was transformed into something uniquely Japanese. This book offers a revisionist history explaining why manga shares the same origins as comics worldwide, emerging in response to motion pictures and sound recording technology.
