In "Cartoon Vision, " Dan Bashara explores how American animation evolved alongside postwar modern design, focusing on United Productions of America (UPA) and its influential graphic style. Through theoretical frameworks and historical context, the book examines animation as a laboratory for reimagining vision and space, bridging art, architecture, and film. Bashara advocates for animation's role in training public perception to keep pace with a changing modern world, invoking the American Bauhaus legacy of Moholy-Nagy and Kepes. This work reveals the profound connections between animated imagery and mid-century modernism's broader design project.
