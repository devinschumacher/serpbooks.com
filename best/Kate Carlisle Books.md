*A Photographic History of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School*

<br>

Through carefully curated photographs, this book traces the controversial history of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School from its founding in 1879 to its closure in 1918. The images, originally meant to showcase the school's progress in assimilating Native American children into mainstream white society, now serve as powerful tools for understanding the darker legacy of federal Indian boarding schools. Kate Theimer's scholarly work reveals how these photographs, once used to promote the school's dubious successes, can inform modern viewers about the true impact of such institutions on Native American culture and identity.
