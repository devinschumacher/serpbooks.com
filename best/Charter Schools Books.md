*An Assessment of the Koret Task Force on K–12 Education*

<br>

Charter schools face significant legal and policy barriers that limit their ability to provide quality education. This Hoover Press volume examines how state laws restrict the number of charter schools, prohibit for-profit involvement, and impose financial burdens that force schools to pay rent from operating funds. The Koret Task Force contributors offer detailed assessments of these policies and propose amendments to create a more level playing field, ensuring charter schools and the children they serve have a fair chance to succeed.

In this eye-opening book, Thomas Sowell reveals the stark contrasts between charter school and traditional public school performances through real-world examples and data. He examines why charter school students in New York City achieve proficiency on state tests at significantly higher rates than their public school counterparts, despite having similar resources and taking the same exams. The book also explores the contentious relationship between public school officials and charter schools, highlighting the lengths some districts go to prevent students from transferring to charter schools, including blocking access to vacant school buildings and even demolishing them to ensure no charter school can use the space.

*What the End of Traditional Public Schools in New Orleans Means for American Education*

In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, public schools in New Orleans underwent a radical transformation: the traditional system was replaced entirely with charter schools and school choice. Fifteen years later, this market-based experiment has yielded remarkable results, with non-profit charter managers operating under performance contracts and families selecting schools across the city. As Douglas N. Harris reveals through rigorous evaluation, these reforms succeeded on nearly every measurable outcome, offering powerful lessons for the future of American education.
