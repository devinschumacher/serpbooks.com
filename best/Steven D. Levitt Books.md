*Living and Thriving in an Age of Isolation*

<br>

In "Survival of the City, " Edward Glaeser and David Cutler, two of our greatest urbanists, examine how cities are evolving in the face of existential threats that the pandemic has only accelerated. They argue that while digital advances mean many can opt out of city life, the essential human connections and creativity that urban environments foster cannot be replicated elsewhere. The authors highlight how effective city management has become even more critical, particularly in addressing deep inequities in health care and education that threaten to drive a wedge between urban and rural America. Through rigorous analysis and compelling prose, this Penguin publication offers both a warning and a hope: while individual cities face unprecedented risks, the collective future of urban life hangs in the balance between innovation and failure.
