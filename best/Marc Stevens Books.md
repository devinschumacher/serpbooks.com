*A Novel of the Next World War*

<br>

In the year 2034, a routine US Navy patrol in the South China Sea becomes the catalyst for a global conflagration when an American destroyer sinks beneath the waves and a Marine aviator becomes an Iranian prisoner. From the bowels of a Chinese submarine to the halls of the Pentagon, this tightly-wound geopolitical thriller follows an extraordinary cast of characters as cyber weapons and strategic blunders rewrite the rules of modern warfare. As the world's military superpowers collide, two former military officers blend their expertise into a chilling portrait of a future that's all too close at hand.
