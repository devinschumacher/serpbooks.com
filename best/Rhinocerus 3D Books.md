<br>

This comprehensive handbook examines the development and application of computational human models, known as "phantoms, " in radiation dosimetry. Authored by 64 international experts, the book covers 40 years of progress in the field, from early MIRD-5 phantoms to the latest ICRP Reference Phantoms. It details the physical and computational challenges overcome in creating these models, which range from pediatric to adult sizes and include both whole-body and organ-specific designs. The text explores how these phantoms are used in various medical applications, from CT scans to proton therapy, and discusses the transition from voxel-based to more interactive 3D models using software like Rhinoceros. As the International Commission on Radiological Protection adopts voxelized phantoms as standards, this volume provides essential guidance on their use in environmental, nuclear power, and medical radiation protection dosimetry.

*Grasshopper*

<br>

In architecture schools today, complex building models with intricate facades and precise laser marks are commonplace - crafted using everything from 3D printers to advanced software. While critics argue that students often prioritize form over function, it's undeniable that they've become masters of geometric expression through digital tools. This book is part of the Digital Media Series (DMS), focusing on Grasshopper - the powerful algorithmic design tool that's revolutionizing architectural modeling. Building on the principles introduced in the series' first book about Rhinoceros, this volume demystifies Grasshopper's component-based design through clear geometric relationships and practical examples. It's designed to help readers transition smoothly from explicit to implicit modeling, with an emphasis on structured geometry manipulation: from points to curves, from curves to surfaces, and from surfaces to volumes. While the book serves as a comprehensive introduction to Grasshopper's basics, it also encourages readers to explore the wealth of online resources available, from official documentation to user forums, making it an essential guide for anyone wanting to master this transformative design tool.
