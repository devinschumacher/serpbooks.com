## [Academic Charisma and the Origins of the Research University](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Academic+Charisma+and+the+Origins+of+the+Research+University?i=stripbooks)

![Academic Charisma and the Origins of the Research University | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/sIKVElf-txYC?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

"Academic Charisma and the Origins of the Research University" by William Clark traces the evolution of academia from Renaissance Italy to 19th-century Germany, where market forces and bureaucratic demands collided to create the modern research university. This scholarly work examines how oral exams, research papers, and publication culture developed, transforming learned professionals into modern researchers driven by the twin goals of originality and fame. Clark's ambitious study, supported by extensive research, argues that the German Protestant university model, with its emphasis on "lecturing with applause" and "publish or perish, " became the global standard for academic institutions.
