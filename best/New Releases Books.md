*Lincoln and His Cabinet and the Financing of the Civil War*

<br>

In this meticulously researched financial history, Roger Lowenstein exposes the critical role of economic policy in determining the outcome of the Civil War. While military engagements raged across battlefields, Lincoln's administration fought a parallel war of taxes, bonds, and monetary reform that would either sustain the Union or plunge it deeper into crisis. As the Confederate economy collapsed under the weight of its own limitations, the North transformed itself through groundbreaking legislation that established the federal government as a dynamic force in American life. Through the masterful storytelling of a journalist who has made complex financial matters accessible to general readers, "Ways and Means" reveals how the most far-reaching reforms in the nation's history emerged from the crucible of war.
