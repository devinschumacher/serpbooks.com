*The sweeping new novel from the Sunday Times bestseller*

<br>

From small-town Ireland in the 1940s to the vibrant art scene of 1960s New York, "Frankie" is a masterfully written novel that sweeps readers through decades of cultural and personal evolution. Told through the eyes of Frankie Powell, an inspiring figure who has lived a life on the periphery, the story unfolds as she shares her experiences with her young Irish carer, Damian. As Frankie narrates, their small London flat becomes the backdrop for an intimate exploration of what it means to be an artist, a writer, and most importantly, a person who has never been the leading lady in her own life. Through their fragmented storytelling, readers encounter a world of New York artists on the brink of fame, aspiring writers, and larger-than-life characters that populate both the canvas and the pages of this remarkable book.
