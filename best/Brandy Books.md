While his peers race to transplant organs, White fixes his gaze on the ultimate prize: the human soul. This brilliant surgeon, beloved by two popes and founder of the Vatican's Commission on Bioethics, channels his dark genius into experiments that blur the lines between life and death. As he fights against the relentless march of mortality, White's groundbreaking work gives us a front-row seat to the birth of modern neurosurgery and the ethical quagmire that surrounds it.

In this historical fan fiction celebrating the 50th anniversary of the 1972 hit song "Brandy, You're a Fine Girl, " award-winning author Dee DeTarsio weaves a tale of a barmaid named Brandy who schemes to escape her mundane life by marrying a nobleman's son, Elliot. When her initial plan fails, she finds herself part of a grander adventure than she ever imagined, her fate intertwining with Elliot's best friend Beau in unexpected ways. As Brandy navigates a world of noble traditions and social expectations, she discovers that love and marriage are far more complicated than any song can capture. This 224-page story proves that sometimes the best adventures begin when you're least prepared for them.
