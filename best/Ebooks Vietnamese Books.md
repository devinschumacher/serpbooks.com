*Domesticity, Class, Gender, and Identity*

<br>

Since Vietnam introduced economic reforms in the mid-1980s, domestic service has become an essential sector of the labor market, with domestic workers playing a crucial role in urban life. This ethnographic study examines how domestic service practices and discourses shape and challenge emerging class identities in post-reform Vietnam, revealing the complex interplay between gender, rural-urban differences, and socialist legacies. Through rich qualitative data, including interviews and narratives, the book illustrates how domestic workers negotiate class boundaries set by the urban middle class, whose notions of domesticity both reflect and reinforce broader political-economic processes in this transitioning country.

Through carefully selected primary sources and historical accounts, author Gail Paradise Kelly sheds light on a pivotal moment in Vietnamese history, highlighting the diverse experiences of those who chose or were forced to leave their homeland. Their story is one of courage, resilience, and the timeless human struggle to find safety and freedom in the face of chaos.
