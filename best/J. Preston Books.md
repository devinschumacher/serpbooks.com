## [Modernism's Mythic Pose](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Modernisms+Mythic+Pose?i=stripbooks)

![Modernism's Mythic Pose | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/cfVoAgAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

*Gender, Genre, Solo Performance*

<br>

In this innovative study, Carrie J. Preston reveals how modernist artists drew inspiration from the ancient world to create hybrid forms of solo performance. Examining works across literature, dance, photography, and film, the book demonstrates how a "mythic pose" emerged as a key element of modernist expression. Centering on the Delsartism movement, which promoted poetic recitation and mythic statue-posing for health and spiritual development, the study shows how these techniques influenced canonical modernists like Pound and Eliot, as well as figures like Isadora Duncan and H. D. Through interdisciplinary analysis, Preston argues that modernism's engagement with antiquity represented both an escape from and a critique of modernity, offering readers a fresh perspective on this pivotal period in artistic development.

![Modernism's Mythic Pose | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/i\_4TDAAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

*Gender, Genre, Solo Performance*

<br>

Modernism's Mythic Pose recovers the tradition of Delsartism, a popular international movement that promoted bodily and vocal solo performances, particularly for women. This strain of classical-antimodernism shaped dance, film, and poetics through its central figure, the mythic pose, which expressed both skepticism and nostalgia as an ambivalent break from modernity. The book traces this tradition from Isadora Duncan's Moscow school in 1921 to the influential works of Percy Mackaye and his father, highlighting the pivotal role of solo performance in bridging classical and modernist aesthetics.
