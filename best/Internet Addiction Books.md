*A Critical Psychology of Users*

<br>

In this groundbreaking work, Emaline Friedman redefines Internet Addiction within the broader context of digital capitalism and imperialism. Drawing from Deleuze and Guattari's radical philosophy, the book critiques conventional psychological approaches that focus on individual pathology, instead arguing for a politicized understanding of excessive net use. Through multidisciplinary evidence, Friedman demonstrates how social media exploits user creativity while proposing alternative frameworks for psychologists and counselors to address this collective societal issue.
