*Understanding (almost) Everything with Rotating Shallow Water Models*

<br>

Geophysical fluid dynamics is a specialized field that examines the motion of fluids in the ocean and outer core, as well as gases in the atmosphere. This book presents a comprehensive study of large- and medium-scale atmospheric and oceanic motions through the lens of the rotating shallow water model, a simplified yet powerful tool that has been fundamental to the field for nearly a century. The model serves as a vertically averaged version of the complex "primitive equations" models, offering valuable insights into principal dynamical processes while requiring fewer computational resources. The book is structured into three parts: the first part covers essential mathematical and physical concepts, the second part explores advanced dynamical phenomena, and the third part discusses recent developments and applications in the field. Throughout the text, author Vladimir Zeitlin emphasizes the development of physical intuition alongside mathematical rigor, making this a valuable resource for students and researchers in geophysical fluid dynamics.
