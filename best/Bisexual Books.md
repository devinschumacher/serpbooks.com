While the LGBT community has made significant strides in North America, bisexual individuals still face decades of misinformation portraying them as indecisive, self-loathing, and untrustworthy. "Claiming the B in LGBT" addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive history of the bisexual movement alongside personal experiences of bisexual activists. The anthology examines how these individuals navigate through a culture dominated by monosexual norms, compulsory monogamy, and rigid gender expectations, offering a vision of bisexuality that extends beyond the traditional gay-straight binary.
