This 1974 report presents the technical analysis conducted by the Project Independence Interagency Natural Gas Task Force, estimating the natural gas industry's production capabilities under two strategies: "business-as-usual" and "accelerated demand. " The findings, which considered policy impacts and resource availability, informed the Project Independence Blueprint without advocating for specific policies.

*A History*

<br>

When natural gas was first discovered in Appalachia in the 19th century, its development as a fuel was rapid. Unlike oil and coal, gas could be moved only by pipeline and required large containers for storage. It was not possible to cope with peak loads without adding excessive pipeline capacity until just before World War II, when two sister gas companies developed a plant to liquefy and store natural gas as a liquid; the liquid was then regasified to deal with peak loads. The liquid is 1/600 the volume of the gas, but it requires storage at an extremely low temperature, 1-260Â°F. This worked well until 14, when a liquid natural gas (LNG) tank in Cleveland ruptured and caused a fire with 130 fatalities. The fire did not end the industry but caused it to pause. Over the next few years the problems in materials, design, standards, and siting were solved. The recognition that liquefaction made LNG transportable without a pipeline was the breakthrough. In 1959 a shipload of LNG went from Louisiana to Britain and restarted the LNG industry. It is now a major worldwide energy industry and the topic of this work.

*A History of Natural Gas in America*

<br>

The history of the United States is deeply intertwined with the energy sector, and natural gas has played a pivotal role in shaping our modern lifestyle. This comprehensive narrative traces the industry's evolution from the 1880s to the present day, highlighting key events and regulatory milestones that have defined the natural gas market. Charles Blanchard examines the New Deal regulatory framework that emerged in the 1920s, its collapse in the 1970s, and the subsequent policies that have led to our current landscape of hydraulic fracking and renewable integration. The book also looks ahead to predict how these trends might influence our energy future.
