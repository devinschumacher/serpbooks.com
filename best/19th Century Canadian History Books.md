<br>

From its deep Indigenous roots to its conflicted relationship with the United States, this expanded history of Canada weaves together the stories of its diverse peoples and institutions. Margaret Conrad's social-historical approach examines the complex interactions between Canada's original inhabitants and European settlers, as well as the country's religious, gender, and economic divisions. Despite its global appeal as an immigrant destination, Canada emerges as a cautionary tale of a nation-state that remains markedly divided in the 21st century.
