*Cardinals in the Fifteenth Century*

<br>

The fifteenth century marked a pivotal era for the College of Cardinals, as they navigated accusations of prolonging the Avignon exile and causing the schism. At the period's outset, their very existence was debated at ecclesiastical councils. However, through their instrumental role in reclaiming Rome when the papacy returned in 1420, the cardinals rebuilt their relationship with the popes and emerged as a powerful force for restoring the Eternal City. Leveraging their typically longer tenures compared to individual popes, the cardinals collectively shaped a transformative chapter in Rome's history and Renaissance art.

When rancher Joe Lawson rescues Daisy West and her twin foster-babies from a car accident, their lives become unexpectedly intertwined. Daisy's ingenious plan to announce their fake engagement saves Joe from his meddling family, but their growing connection threatens to upend everything. As Christmas approaches, these two strong-willed individuals must decide if risking their hearts is worth it. In the same small Texas town, widower Boone Jarrett returns to his family ranch with his young daughter Hailey. When the bold rodeo rider Violet Byrd challenges his protective instincts by teaching Hailey to ride, Boone finds himself drawn to her despite knowing she's completely off-limits. Between family expectations, work pressures, and their own reservations, both Joe and Boone face choices that could change their futures. In this heartwarming Western romance, two couples navigate the complicated territory between friendship and something far more dangerous.
