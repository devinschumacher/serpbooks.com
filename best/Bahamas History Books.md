This groundbreaking ethnography traces the formation and evolution of a distinct community within the African diaspora, following 200 Black Seminoles as they escape plantation life in the American South and settle on Andros Island in the Bahamas. Isolated for nearly 150 years, the "Red Bays" community emerges through a intricate process of identity formation and cultural change, blending African, Native American, and Bahamian influences in unprecedented ways. Based on extensive archival research and oral histories, this work offers an intimate window into the adaptive strategies and social memories that sustained this unique group through generations of exile and change.
