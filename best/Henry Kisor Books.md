*The Battle to Save the Daily New Orleans Times-Picayune*

In May 2012, the New York Times revealed a stunning transformation for the Pulitzer Prize-winning New Orleans Times-Picayune: reducing its publication schedule from daily to three days a week.

Through intimate glimpses into the decision-making process and its aftermath, this business and economics title offers an insider's account of a turbulent period that tested the newspaper's commitment to its readers and its legacy as a journalistic institution.
