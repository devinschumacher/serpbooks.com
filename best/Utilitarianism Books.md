<br>

John Stuart Mill's 1861 Utilitarianism stands as a monumental work in moral philosophy, presenting a rigorous framework for ethical decision-making based on the principle of maximizing happiness. The book exemplifies critical thinking through Mill's meticulous examination of right and wrong, proposing that actions are morally good if they increase overall happiness and bad if they decrease it. Central to his argument is the distinction between one's own happiness and the total happiness of all affected by an action, a nuanced perspective that informs his systematic approach to evaluating different qualities and aspects of happiness. Throughout the work, Mill anticipates and addresses potential objections, constructing a logically coherent defense of utilitarianism that continues to influence ethical theory and practice.

Utilitarianism by John Stuart Mill presents a comprehensive defense of utilitarian ethics, explaining why happiness is the highest good and how to maximize it. Published originally in Fraser's Magazine and later as a standalone work, this essay collects Mill's most influential arguments for utilitarianism, demonstrating why it surpasses other moral theories. Mill, building on the foundations laid by Bentham and Paley, defends hedonistic utilitarianism against numerous criticisms, establishing it as the most rational approach to ethics.

Originally published in 1982, "The Limits of Utilitarianism" explores the philosophical foundations and ethical implications of utilitarian thinking. Through four key aspects - the principle of utility, utilitarianism versus contractarianism, welfare economics, and voluntary cooperation - this collection challenges readers to consider the extent to which utilitarian principles can and should shape public policy. The editors present contemporary perspectives on a tradition dating back to Bentham and Mill, offering both criticisms and defenses of utilitarianism's role in modern moral theory.
