*The Future of Energy and the Fate of the Planet*

<br>

Since the late 18th century, coal has fueled human progress, powering everything from steam engines to modern electricity generation. Today, this ubiquitous mineral generates nearly 45% of the world's power, making our technological society possible. However, coal's environmental toll is devastating: it produces 43% of global carbon emissions, making it the largest single source of greenhouse gases. In "Coal Wars, " author Richard Martin examines the high-stakes battle to replace coal with cleaner energy sources before it's too late. Traveling from Wyoming to China's Shanxi Province, Martin chronicles the industry's decline and the bold efforts of groups like the Sierra Club to accelerate its demise. As coal plants shutter across the United States and Europe turns to natural gas, the race intensifies to shift the world's energy infrastructure away from this polluting source. The stakes couldn't be higher: coal's dominance threatens the future of our planet, and its decline will transform economies and communities worldwide. Through meticulous research and compelling storytelling, "Coal Wars" stands as a crucial chronicle of energy's most pressing challenge.

<br>

America has officially entered the coal cost crossover, where existing coal plants are becoming increasingly expensive compared to cleaner alternatives. This report analyzes which coal plants could be replaced locally with wind and solar within 35 miles, finding that 74% of the U. S. coal fleet could be swapped out immediately for cost savings, growing to 86% by 2025. The authors examine the economic viability of replacing coal with combinations of local or remote wind, solar, transmission, storage, and demand response, while considering the impacts on communities that depend on these aging coal plants.
