*African Spirituality in American Cinema*

<br>

Through an interdisciplinary lens, this cinematic study examines how American films represent black women in African-derived religions, unearthing the complex interplay of race, gender, and spirituality in Hollywood's portrayal of Africana religious practices. Martin analyzes seventy-five years of film, from Disney's Princess and the Frog to earlier cinematic depictions of conjure and Voodoo, developing the concept of Voodoo aesthetics to understand the inscription of African cosmologies on the black female body. Her work interrogates whether film can serve as a safe space for black women's religious expression, offering a compelling framework for understanding the cultural impact of these representations on both black female spectatorship and American perceptions of African diasporic religion.
