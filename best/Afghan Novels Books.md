*A Secret History of the War*

<br>

In this meticulously researched investigative work, Washington Post reporter Craig Whitlock reveals the stark contrast between public perception and reality during America's longest war in Afghanistan. Drawing from over 1,000 interviews and previously undisclosed documents, "The Afghanistan Papers" exposes how three consecutive presidential administrations misled the public while grappling with an increasingly complex conflict that stretched far beyond the initial mission to defeat al-Qaeda. As the official narrative crumbled under the weight of contradictory evidence, a cast of military and civilian leaders navigated a landscape of drugs, corruption, and misinformation that threatened to consume everything they had fought to achieve. Through unflinching accounts from key figures including President Bush, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, and General Petraeus, this book stands as a powerful rebuke to the strategies and decisions that shaped one of the most contentious chapters in American military history.
