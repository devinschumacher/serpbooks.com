## [An Architecture for Fast and General Data Processing on Large Clusters](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/An+Architecture+for+Fast+and+General+Data+Processing+on+Large+Clusters?i=stripbooks)

![An Architecture for Fast and General Data Processing on Large Clusters | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/TNUlDAAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

As data volumes grow and processor speeds stall, organizations increasingly need to scale out their computations over clusters. This revised dissertation proposes an architecture that extends MapReduce to support streaming and interactive queries while maintaining fault tolerance and scalability. Through the introduction of Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs), the author demonstrates how to capture a wide range of workloads within a single framework. Implemented in the open-source Spark system, this architecture matches or exceeds the performance of specialized systems across multiple domains, allowing rich new applications that combine streaming and batch processing. The theoretical foundations and generality of RDDs are rigorously examined, providing both a mathematical model and systems-level analysis to support this novel approach to cluster computing.
