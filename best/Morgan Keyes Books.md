From one of America's most beloved television actresses comes a sharply observed, comedic novel about the flipside of fame. Kate Keyes-Morgan appears to have it all - a starring role on Generations, a handsome husband who doubles as her manager, and a figure to envy - but beneath the surface lies a woman struggling with the industry's relentless pressure to be thinner, younger, and more beautiful. When her husband leaves her for another actress, Kate must navigate Hollywood without its most stringent rulebook, discovering who she really is with the help of her wise-cracking hairstylist friend Paige and a high-powered film agent who secretly dreams of becoming a novelist. As she questions her place in an entertainment world that values appearance above all else, Kate's journey offers a fresh take on Hollywood - its high fashion, on-set antics, and the whispers about celebrities that never make it to the tabloids.
