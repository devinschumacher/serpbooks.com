When the king dies, leaving no heir, a small band of warriors must find the last possible candidate to restore order. Their desperate search leads them to Colbey Calistinsson, a Renshai warrior, who must choose between two powerful staffs that hold the fate of their world in their grasp. The wrong decision could extinguish all life, while the right one requires sacrifices that no hero should be forced to make.
