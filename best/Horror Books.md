*Cinematic Fear and the Secret Life of Everyday Objects*

<br>

Household Horror invites readers to explore the dark side of everyday objects through the lens of horror cinema. By examining 14 common household items featured in classic and contemporary horror films, scholar Marc Olivier reveals how these seemingly benign objects transform ordinary spaces into arenas of terror. From microwave ovens that kill gremlins to typewriters that influence human behavior, these cinematic artifacts come to life on screen, often taking center stage in their respective films. Olivier's work places objects on par with human actors, offering fresh insights into familiar horrors like Psycho and The Exorcist while introducing readers to lesser-known gems in the genre. Through this object-oriented approach, Household Horror uncovers the underlying cultural fears and societal concerns that give these everyday items their cinematic power.

<br>

Horror films have long been a cultural barometer for societal fears and anxieties, using the darkest corners of cinema to explore what it means to be human in a world of "others. " Through precise analysis of the genre's most influential works, from Tobe Hooper's groundbreaking contributions to Jordan Peele's modern masterpieces, this book reveals how horror cinema has evolved to challenge our most fundamental distinctions between self and other. Rather than presenting a static dichotomy between normality and monstrosity, these films depict a fluid landscape where the frightening "other" is not an external threat but a reflection of our own vulnerabilities and prejudices. It's a terrifying journey through cinema that ultimately forces us to confront the possibility that we are all, in some way, the monster lurking in the shadows of our collective consciousness.
