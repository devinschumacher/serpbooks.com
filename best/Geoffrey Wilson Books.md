![A Medievalist in the Eighteenth Century | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/lGPuCAAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

*Le Grand dâ€™Aussy and the Fabliaux ou Contes*

<br>

This scholarly work challenges the notion that France's engagement with medieval literature began only in the 19th century, revealing instead an extensive tradition of "historically oriented medievalism" that spans from the 16th to the 18th century. Through detailed analysis of little-known scholars like La Curne de Sainte-Palaye and the Comte de Caylus, Geoffrey Wilson demonstrates how these early researchers laid crucial groundwork for later generations of medievalists, particularly through their exhaustive studies of fabliaux and historical texts. The book thus repositions the 18th century as a pivotal period in the development of medieval studies, where scholarly curiosity about the Middle Ages transitioned from mere historical interest to a sophisticated literary appreciation.
