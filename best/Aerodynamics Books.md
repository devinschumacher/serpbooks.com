<br>

"High-Lift Aerodynamics" by Jochen Wild offers an in-depth exploration of the aerodynamic principles behind lift augmentation systems in civil transport aircraft. The book examines the physical limits of lift generation and the specific requirements for certifying high-lift systems, while also discussing the various passive and active means used to increase lift coefficients during takeoff and landing. Through detailed analysis of slotless and slotted high-lift flaps, vortex generating devices, and powered lift systems, this work provides both graduate students and professional engineers with valuable insights into the design and evaluation of high-lift aerodynamic systems.
