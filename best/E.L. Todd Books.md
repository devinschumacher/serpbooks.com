*El Salvador, the United States, and Struggles against Empire*

<br>

During the 1980s, a unique form of citizen diplomacy emerged as hundreds of North American groups forged bonds with war-torn villages in Guatemala, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. Drawing from twenty years of research and unprecedented access to private archives, Molly Todd chronicles how ordinary people, inspired by refugees displaced by US-supported counterinsurgency operations, created "grassroots sistering" programs that continue to evolve today. This compelling history reveals the complex dynamics of cross-border activism that arose from relationships between repopulated villages in Chalatenango, El Salvador, and US cities, highlighting the intersection of Salvadoran leadership and left-leaning American activism in the face of expanding empire.
