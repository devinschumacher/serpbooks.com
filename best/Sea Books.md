Sea Energy Agriculture showcases Dr. Maynard Murray's innovative research on minerals and trace elements in farming. Between 1938 and the 1950s, Murray conducted detailed experiments proving that sea solids - mineral deposits from evaporated seawater - significantly boost plant growth and health when used as fertilizer. The study also found that livestock fed crops grown with sea solid fertilizers exhibited improved health and productivity. Although largely unnoticed during his career, Murray's work now stands as a foundational text in sustainable agriculture, supported by insights from Charles Walters, the founder of Acres U. S. A.
