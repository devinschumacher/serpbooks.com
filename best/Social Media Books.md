In this insightful work, Philip M. Napoli examines how social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google have reshaped news consumption and distribution, challenging the notion that these tech companies should operate outside traditional media regulations. He presents a compelling case for governing social media as news media, grounded in a revitalized public interest standard, and explores the implications of an algorithmic marketplace of ideas where code and engineering increasingly drive content creation and distribution.
