In the shadow of a Caribbean sugar plantation, Jenny Jaeckel weaves a masterful tale of the Rougeaux family, whose extraordinary bond unfolds across nearly two centuries. When Abeje and her brother Adunbi lose their mother to plantation brutality, their desperate plight gives way to a legacy of remarkable strength and courage. As each new generation faces staggering challenges, the family's mystical connection brings them back to their roots, illuminating a story of hope and healing through trauma. Through literary prose that blends mysticism with historical fiction, Jaeckel crafts an intimate portrait of a family navigating love amidst the horrors of slavery and its aftermath.
