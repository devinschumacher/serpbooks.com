![Culture & Conflict Resolution | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/OofmUheyGJAC?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

After years of relative neglect, culture is finally receiving due recognition as a key factor in the evolution and resolution of conflicts. Unfortunately, when theorists and practitioners of conflict resolution speak of culture, they often understand and use it in a bewildering variety of ways. With sophistication and lucidity, this book exposes these shortcomings and proposes an alternative conception in which culture is seen as dynamic and derivative of individual experience. It explores divergent theories of social conflict and differing strategies that shape the conduct of diplomacy, examining the role that culture has (and has not) played in conflict resolution. The author challenges both scholars and practitioners to develop a clearer understanding of what culture is and to incorporate this understanding into more effective conflict resolution processes.
