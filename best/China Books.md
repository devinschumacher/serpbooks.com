In this meticulously researched work, historian Marius B. Jansen challenges the conventional view of Japan as an isolated nation during the Tokugawa period, highlighting instead the vibrant trade and cultural exchange that took place between Japan and China from the 16th to the 19th centuries. Focusing on the port of Nagasaki, Jansen reveals how Japanese elites eagerly sought Chinese luxury goods and philosophical texts, while Chinese expatriates and visitors left their mark on Japanese religion, law, and art. As Japan began to assert its national identity, China shifted from representing an idealized land of sages to serving as a foil for Japanese cultural and technological superiority. Through careful analysis of trade records and cultural artifacts, this book offers an intimate window into the complex relationship between these two Asian powers during a transformative period in their shared history.

In this provocative work, China specialist Gordon G. Chang argues that the country's economic and political foundations are far weaker than commonly perceived. Despite predictions of becoming the world's largest economy by 2010, Chang presents a detailed case that China's state-owned enterprises, banking system, and legal framework are in a state of crisis, with corruption and deflation gripping the nation. As China prepares for World Trade Organization membership, the author foresees that increased foreign competition will exacerbate these internal struggles, potentially leading to government collapse. Through careful analysis of China's political landscape, legal system, and international relations, Chang provides a comprehensive look at the challenges facing this "paper dragon, " making a compelling argument that the country's path between communism and capitalism has left it dangerously unprepared for the future.
