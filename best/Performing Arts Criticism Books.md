*The Performance of Self from Robert Lowell to Reality TV*

<br>

"The Art of Confession" chronicles the evolution of confessionalism in American art, examining how this once literary movement transformed nearly every creative medium of its time. From Robert Lowell's influential poetry to the rise of reality television, Christopher Grobe traces the cultural shift that turned private struggles into public performances. This NYU Press publication reveals how confessionalism emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional autobiography, encouraging artists to engage directly with their audience through the raw, often challenging truths of their personal experiences.

*The Death of the New York City Opera and the Future of Opera in America*

<br>

When the New York City Opera (NYCO) declared bankruptcy in 2013, it marked the end of an era for American opera. This populist company had thrived for 70 years as a nurturing ground for young talent and a venue for bold artistic expressions, standing in stark contrast to the more established Metropolitan Opera. Through meticulous research and reporting, Wall Street Journal critic Heidi Waleson chronicles NYCO's remarkable journey from a visionary startup to a financially fragile institution, highlighting the eternal tension between artistic ambition and fiscal responsibility that continues to challenge performing arts organizations nationwide.
