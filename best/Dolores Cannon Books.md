In 1945, Earth's spiritual protectors witnessed an impending disaster and devised a plan to save the planet through voluntary assistance from other dimensions. When direct intervention was impossible, they called for pure souls to volunteer from within, initiating three waves of visitors from the Source and other realms. These volunteers, arriving with no memory of their mission, face challenges adjusting to Earth's chaos while playing crucial roles in the planet's ascension. As the old and new Earths separate, these beings work alongside light beings and grid keepers to facilitate the transition. The book explores how this shift affects every aspect of life on Earth, highlighting the year 2012 as a significant turning point in our collective journey towards a new reality.
