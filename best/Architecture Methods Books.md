## [Formal Methods in Architecture and Urbanism](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Formal+Methods+in+Architecture+and+Urbanism?i=stripbooks)

![Formal Methods in Architecture and Urbanism | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/PluLzgEACAAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

This architectural treatise explores how formal methods can revolutionize problem-solving in architecture and urbanism. By developing new explicit languages grounded in mathematical theory, the authors demonstrate how architecture can become more precise and efficient. The book synthesizes cutting-edge research from multiple disciplines, including BIM/VDC, CAD/CAM, and parametric design, while also tracing the historical evolution of geometric principles in architecture. Through case studies and theoretical frameworks, it shows how formalization can lead to more accurate solutions with reduced testing time, marking a significant step forward in architectural methodology.
