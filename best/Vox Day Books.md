*Dissecting the Unholy Trinity of Dawkins, Harris, And Hitchens*

<br>

In this meticulously researched work, Vox Day counters the arguments of prominent New Atheists like Dawkins and Harris with cold, hard facts. Drawing from military history, political economy, and statistical analysis, Day demonstrates that religion is not the cause of war, that the Spanish Inquisition was far less deadly than often claimed, and that atheism correlates with higher rates of imprisonment and suicide. His evidence spans from ancient civilizations to the 20th century, showing that atheistic regimes have been more lethal in peacetime than all religious conflicts combined.

When the Most Sanctified Charity IV commissions an inquiry into the elvish controversy, he sets in motion a chain of events that will forever alter the fate of both men and elves. As a young noble, Marcus Valerius, accompanies two great theologians on their transformative journey through elven realms, he encounters beauty beyond human comprehension and secrets that threaten to overturn everything he holds sacred. This philosophical adventure explores the very nature of consciousness and identity, questioning what it means to be alive in a universe where the impossible becomes mundane. "Summa Elvetica" stands as a profound meditation on faith, reason, and the eternal quest for understanding in a world where magic and history intertwine.

*Taking Down the Thought Police*

<br>

In this provocative work, Vox Day exposes the Social Justice Warriors (SJWs) as the ideological vanguard that has reshaped Western culture over the past 30 years. From corporate boardrooms to academic halls, these self-appointed thought police have wielded their doctrine of diversity and tolerance as a blunt instrument, silencing dissent and distorting truth. Through carefully selected case studies, including the successful pushback of #GamerGate and Sad Puppies, Day provides both insight into SJW tactics and hope for those who refuse to live in a world where "SJWs always lie" becomes the accepted norm.

*How "conservatives" Betrayed America*

<br>

Fifty years ago, America experienced a radical transformation in immigration law that few predicted and even fewer debated. Since then, the United States has endured the largest mass migration in human history, with consequences that reach into every aspect of American life. Native American authors John Red Eagle and Vox Day present a powerful defense of America's right to exist as a distinct nation, challenging the myths that support open borders and multiculturalism. Through careful analysis of economics, history, and theology, this work demonstrates why mass immigration undermines American sovereignty and threatens to erase the cultural legacy that defines the nation. The authors warn that without a return to conservative principles that prioritize America's posterity and national interest, future generations will face their own Trail of Tears as the founding values of the United States disappear beneath an avalanche of change.

In a United States where women's voices are literally silenced, Dr. Jean McClellan fights to protect herself and her daughter against a government that threatens to strip away their right to speak. When the authorities decree that females can only utter one hundred words per day, McClellan channels her scientific expertise to challenge the system that seeks to render them voiceless. In this electrifying debut, Christina Dalcher weaves a tale of motherhood, science, and resistance that recalls the darkest days of totalitarian regimes while offering a glimmer of hope for a future where women's voices matter once again.
