![Jose Maria Gil-Robles | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/w0MpswEACAAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

*Leader of the Catholic Right During the Spanish Second Republic*

<br>

This meticulously researched biography examines Jose Maria Gil-Robles as the founder of Spain's first modern right-wing party, the CEDA, during the tumultuous Second Republic from 1931 to 1936. The book explores how Gil-Robles led conservative forces that were decidedly anti-fascist but equally opposed to Marxism and liberal individualism. Through careful analysis of the political landscape that culminated in the 1936 Civil War, author Manuel Álvarez Tardío provides crucial insights into why the CEDA failed to achieve its objectives, offering a balanced view of Gil-Robles's complex legacy in Spanish politics.
