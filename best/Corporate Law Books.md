*Contradictions of Corporate Law, Economics, and the Theory of the Firm*

<br>

In this thought-provoking continuation of his earlier work, Wm. Dennis Huber applies legal principles to challenge conventional economic theories about corporations, ownership, and investment. Through rigorous analysis of corporate law, property law, and legal frameworks, Huber demonstrates how modern economic systems often disregard fundamental legal principles, leading to misconceptions about corporate governance and capital ownership. This 326-page examination reveals why, in the realm of publicly traded corporations, traditional notions of capitalism and private ownership no longer apply, offering both legal scholars and economists a fresh perspective on corporate law and the theory of the firm.
