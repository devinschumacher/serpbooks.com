In this incisive study, historian J. L. Granatstein argues that Canadian history is being systematically erased from public consciousness through misguided educational policies and multicultural initiatives. Drawing from startling statistics on young Canadians' historical illiteracy and his own expertise, Granatstein demonstrates how the social studies approach to teaching history has failed to instill basic knowledge of our nation's past. The book, timed to coincide with the Vimy Ridge centenary, serves as both a damning indictment of current historical education practices and a call to action to preserve Canada's rich cultural heritage before it's too late.

*A Unified History of the United States and Canada*

<br>

In this witty and accessible work, historian Robert Bothwell argues that the shared history of the United States and Canada reveals more about each country than most would suspect. Tracing their intertwined paths from the seventeenth century to the present day, he shows how Canadian-American relations, shared values, and differences have evolved over the centuries. From universal health care to foreign policy decisions, Bothwell demonstrates that what happens in one country often reflects or signals developments in the other, challenging the notion that the United States is either unique or exceptional in its characteristics and shortcomings.

*Epic Stories of Charting a Mysterious Land*

Through ten meticulously selected maps, this award-winning work journeys back to a time when Canada was a blank slate, inviting readers to witness the evolution of a nation through the eyes of its earliest mappers. From wandering Vikings who thought they'd entered a land of myth to Samuel de Champlain's first tentative sketches, each map tells a story of discovery and conflict that forged Canada's history. By combining cartography with storytelling, this 384-page volume reveals the Canada that lies beneath the history books, where mythical creatures soared through the skies and the boundaries of imagination knew no limits.
