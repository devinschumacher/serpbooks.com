Through meticulously constructed scenarios and performative interventions, American artist Buck Ellison examines the visual language of privilege in his debut monograph, 'Living Trust'. The LA-based artist uses photography as a lens to explore how upper-middle-class families maintain and broadcast their social status, from organic vegetables and wellness therapies to expensive sports equipment and family portraits. By staging these carefully researched images and employing actors to inhabit generic roles, Ellison creates an ambivalent portrait of W. A. S. P. America where authentic experiences are increasingly commodified and aestheticized. The 96-page color photography collection challenges viewers to consider the subtle ways in which whiteness and privilege shape our daily lives and visual culture.

*Portraits of the Us*

<br>

Through 240 pages of 35mm film photography, French-born photographer Larry Niehues captures modern America in a style that echoes the mid-century works of Robert Frank and Dennis Hopper. His five-year journey across the United States documents the enduring presence of "Old America" amidst the country's beauty and decay, tradition and innovation. The book features portraits of everyday people and iconic small-town life, from dusty motels to bustling diners, all shot with an authenticity that evokes the spirit of William Eggleston and Bruce Davidson.
