Focusing on the work of Franz Boas and Bronislaw Malinowski, the eight essays explore anthropology's development as an academic discipline grounded in systematic fieldwork. Drawing from unpublished manuscripts, the collection examines the field's mythic origins, its scientific aspirations, and the tensions between objective inquiry and subjective experience. Stocking provides historical context from ancient Greece to the 20th century, offering both retrospective insights and prospective reflections on anthropology's future as an integrative discipline bridging natural science and humanism.

*Continuity and Revolution in Americanist Anthropology*

<br>

The arrival of Franz Boas in North America marked a pivotal turning point in the field of anthropology, introducing revolutionary theoretical and methodological approaches that would shape the discipline for generations to come. This comprehensive volume examines the transformative impact of Boas and his pioneering students, including linguist Edward Sapir, highlighting the enduring legacy of their work within both academic and museum settings. Through careful analysis of the period spanning from the founding of the Bureau of American Ethnology in 1879 to the establishment of anthropology as a distinct academic field around 1920, Regna Darnell illustrates how Boas's vision of scientific anthropology evolved from symbolic culture studies to become the foundation of modern anthropological practice in North America.

![The Limits of Multiculturalism | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/ytKHwCCMgv4C?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

*Interrogating the Origins of American Anthropology*

<br>

In the early 19th century, American anthropology emerged as a profession when European Americans began studying Native Americans. This book reveals the often-overlooked role of Native American anthropologists who were publishing ethnographic accounts of their own people during the same period. By examining the work of Native American writers like David Cusick, Jane Johnston, and William Apess alongside their white counterparts, Scott Michaelsen challenges conventional multiculturalism and shows how Indian voices have always been central to the field of anthropology.

*Theory, Politics, Praxis, and Poetics*

In the early days of anthropology, the field was dominated by white male scholars, leaving women and black researchers on its periphery. This groundbreaking collection brings together essays by black feminist anthropologists who have worked across Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States.

Drawing from their own fieldwork experiences, these scholars examine the personal and theoretical challenges they've faced in the discipline, offering valuable insights into the making of black feminist anthropology.

*Reconstruction, Reconciliation, and Dreams of a National Pastime*

In the decade following the Civil War, baseball underwent a transformative journey that would forever alter its landscape.

Through meticulous research and engaging storytelling, Ryan A. Swanson examines how baseball became a microcosm of the nation's struggle with race and reconciliation, highlighting the fascinating characters and pivotal moments that shaped the sport's problematic path to the twentieth century.

*Encounters and Fabulations at the Edges of the Human*

<br>

What might anthropology become if it were to abandon its claims as a social science and instead explore its connections with art and literature? This innovative work by Stuart McLean suggests that anthropology has much to learn from creative expressions that disrupt traditional notions of human and non-human boundaries. Drawing from a diverse array of sources including ancient mythology, literary works, and multimedia art, "Fictionalizing Anthropology" demonstrates how experiments with language and form can reveal alternative possibilities of collective existence in our increasingly complex world.

*The Story of Salvage Anthropology*

<br>

In the late 19th century, a scientific movement known as salvage anthropology emerged, driven by the belief that Indigenous cultures were "vanishing" and needed to be preserved through aggressive collection of artifacts and documentation. This comprehensive effort brought millions of cultural objects from Native communities into museum collections, shaping public education and preservation practices that influence us to this day. Through meticulous research and thoughtful interviews with contemporary Indigenous artists and curators, Samuel Redman examines the complex legacy of this period, revealing how well-meaning preservationist efforts became entangled with scientific racism and colonialist assumptions. The book highlights the ongoing moral challenges of cultural salvage, offering insights into how we might reconcile with this controversial historical episode.
