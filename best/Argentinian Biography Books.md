Eva Perón rose from humble origins to become one of the most powerful women in the world, serving as the First Lady of Argentina from 1946 to 1952.

Taylor, reflect different interpretations of Eva Perón as either an embodiment or violation of the Argentine feminine ideal, depending on the viewer's political and social perspective.
