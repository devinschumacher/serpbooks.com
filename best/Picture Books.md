When Emma the worm decides to have her family's portrait taken, she discovers a unique challenge: her family members don't have teeth or hair, making it difficult to replicate the glamorous photo shoots her animal friends have enjoyed. Undeterred, Emma gathers an assortment of wigs and fake teeth to create elaborate costumes for her parents and sisters. However, it's only when they discard these accessories that the worm family discovers their true photographic potential, wriggling and squigging into a pose that captures their individuality perfectly. Through this charming story, debut author Jennifer Frank celebrates the idea that the most beautiful portraits come from embracing, rather than masking, our unique qualities.
