*Arbus, Arendt, Didion, McCarthy, Sontag, Weil*

<br>

In this insightful literary critique, Deborah Nelson examines six remarkable women whose work challenged the notion that empathy is the primary ethical stance toward pain. Focusing on philosopher Simone Weil, writer Hannah Arendt, novelist Mary McCarthy, literary critic Susan Sontag, photographer Diane Arbus, and writer Joan Didion, the book traces how these diverse figures developed intellectual and artistic practices that ranged from detached observation to profound engagement with human suffering. Through their work, these women created a rich legacy that continues to influence how we understand and represent pain in literature and art.
