*Historic Preservation and Virginia Traditionalism*

<br>

In 1889, a group of tradition-minded women from Virginia's most prominent families formed the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (APVA), marking the birth of America's first state preservation organization. Fueled by a determination to rebuild a revered past upon the foundations of historic structures, these early preservationists orchestrated elaborate white-gloved pilgrimages and high-society costume balls while battling among themselves to shape the future of Virginia's architectural heritage. Their efforts would profoundly influence not only the physical landscape of the Old Dominion but the very identity of the South, illustrating how carefully curated historical narratives continue to mold our understanding of national and regional heritage.
