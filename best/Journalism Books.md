*The Fate of Intellect in American Journalism*

<br>

In this provocative work, Michael McDevitt contends that American journalism systematically suppresses complex ideas through practices that commodify knowledge and discourage intellectual diversity. Drawing from two decades of media encounters with dissent since 9/11, McDevitt illustrates how journalism's latent anti-intellectualism shapes story selection and presentation, often reducing nuanced concepts to simplistic binaries that offend neither liberal nor conservative sensibilities. The author traces this phenomenon's roots in U. S. cultural history and its manifestation in professional training, offering both a critical assessment of the current media landscape and practical steps toward a more intellectually rigorous journalism practice.
