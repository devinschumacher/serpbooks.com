Technical debt in software development arises when developers take shortcuts or make poor technical decisions during the early stages of a project, resulting in complex workarounds later. This book offers practical strategies for preventing, identifying, and resolving technical debt, examining its effects throughout the software lifecycle. Drawing from real-world examples at companies like Boeing and Twitter, the authors outline methods for tracking and measuring technical debt across seven key areas: requirements, implementation, testing, architecture, documentation, deployment, and social debt. By addressing these aspects proactively, developers can prevent technical debt from becoming overwhelming and ensure they allocate sufficient time to develop new features that meet customer needs.
