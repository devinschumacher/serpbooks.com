*The Politics of the Common Core State Standards*

<br>

"In Common No More" traces the political evolution of the Common Core State Standards from their 2010 adoption to becoming a contentious issue among educators and parents. The book examines four key areas of conflict: federal vs. state control, minority vs. majority perspectives, expert opinions vs. professional practices, and elite influences vs. local preferences. It evaluates the major debates surrounding the Common Core, including concerns about federal overreach, testing practices, and connections to private education reform funders. The work also reviews the development of state and national standards, providing context for the Common Core controversy through an historical examination of American educational standards reforms.

*National Education Standards and the Threat to Democracy*

<br>

The Common Core State Standards Initiative has transformed K-12 education through standardized curricula in math and English language arts, while similar frameworks have been implemented for science and sexuality education. This policy shift towards national education standards has sparked intense debate, with proponents arguing for higher academic benchmarks and critics warning of centralized government control over educational content and methods. Nicholas Tampio examines the historical, philosophical, and practical implications of these standards, ultimately questioning whether the benefits justify the democratic costs of such a sweeping educational reform.
