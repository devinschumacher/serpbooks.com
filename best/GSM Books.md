## [Statistical analysis of the GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) mobility prediction models](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Statistical+analysis+of+the+GSM+Global+System+for+Mobile+Communications+mobility+prediction+models?i=stripbooks)

<br>

In the GSM environment, mobility prediction plays a crucial role in anticipating a mobile station's next movement, enabling enhanced resource allocation, cell assignment, and call admission control. This research paper statistically analyzes existing mobility prediction models, highlighting their limitations in accounting for real-world complexities such as overlapping base transceiver stations. The authors propose a novel generic model that addresses these shortcomings by focusing on accurate cell-level prediction, supported by specific requirements derived from the limitations of current models.
