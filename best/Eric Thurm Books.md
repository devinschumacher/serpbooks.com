*Why Injustice Can't Be Solved by Accusing Others of Advantage*

*The Agency of Becoming*

<br>

In this provocative philosophical work, Agnes Callard introduces the concept of "aspiration" as a distinct form of agency that shapes our becoming. Drawing from diverse examples of personal and professional development, she examines how individuals transform themselves through activities that challenge their existing values and perspectives. Callard argues that this process of self-creation is marked by intrinsic conflict and cannot be understood through conventional notions of choice or decision-making. Instead, she proposes a teleological framework in which aspirants model themselves on their desired future selves, thereby bringing those idealized forms of concern into existence. Through meticulous analysis of the psychological and rational dimensions of aspiration, this book offers a compelling account of how we come to embody the values that define us.

<br>

This scientific study introduces a novel method for reconstructing recent tree and stand attributes of temporary research plots, developed under the European Network on Mixed Forests (COST action FP 1206 EuMIXFOR). The method estimates retrospective tree dynamics and stand characteristics, validating its effectiveness for reconstructing data from the past 5-10 years. By requiring fewer resources than permanent plots, this approach enables the establishment of larger research networks across multiple countries, providing valuable insights into the processes that distinguish mixed forest stands from mono-specific ones.

<br>

"Avidly Reads Guilty Pleasures" by Arielle Zibrak challenges conventional literary criticism by reclaiming so-called "trash" femme fictions. This NYU Press publication explores how these misunderstood works offer surprisingly cathartic experiences of domination, privilege, and materialism within patriarchal culture. Through careful analysis of 169 pages, Zibrak transforms dismissive notions of "guilty pleasure" into nuanced insights about women's writing that subverts and satisfies in equal measure.

*Performing Legitimacy, Performing Unity*

<br>

Between 1378 and 1417, Western Christianity experienced its most significant internal division since the Great Schism of 1054. Two popes, each claiming legitimate succession to St. Peter's throne, established rival courts in Rome and Avignon, leading to a dramatic split within the Church. Through meticulous analysis of liturgical, cultural, artistic, and archival evidence, Joëlle Rollo-Koster examines the four phases of this turbulent period: the initial breach following the 1378 election, the subsequent division of ecclesiastical authority, various redressive actions attempted by both sides, and finally the reintegration of papal power under a single leader. Her work illuminates not only the competing legitimacy claims of the Roman and Avignon popes but also the broader impact of this schism on political thought and religious practice across Europe.
