<br>

In this Hugo Award-winning cyberpunk thriller, author Peter Watts explores the catastrophic aftermath of a nuclear strike on a deep sea vent. The intended target was an ancient microbe capable of driving the entire biosphere to extinction, along with the small group of amphibious humans known as rifters who had unwittingly unleashed it from three billion years of isolation. The resulting tsunami devastates North America's west coast, leaving millions dead and spawning a dark mythology around a figure rising from the ocean depths. As the world teeters on the brink of collapse, a woman with empty white eyes and machinery in her chest becomes the focal point of an escalating global crisis. Lenie Clarke, one of the original rifters, returns from the grave with vengeance in her heart, and the entire planet stands as collateral damage in her pathological quest for revenge. Maelstrom is the second book in Watts' Rifters Trilogy and demonstrates why, in the face of existential threats, the lines between heroism and madness become terrifyingly blurred.

*Politics, Neoliberalism and Violence in the New Narcoeconomy*

<br>

Drug War Mexico examines how Mexico's drug trade has evolved during the neoliberal era, becoming the country's largest source of revenue and its most violent industry.

Through detailed analysis of the drug supply chain and its impacts on Mexican society, Watt and Zepeda argue that the war on drugs serves to justify unpopular neoliberal policies and a fundamentally unfair status quo.
