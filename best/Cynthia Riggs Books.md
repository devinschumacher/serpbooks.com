Whiteness Fractured offers a sophisticated examination of how racial identity intersects with social class, ethnicity, and psychosocial phenomena in contemporary society. Through a critical analysis of existing approaches, this influential work by Cynthia Levine-Rasky proposes new directions for understanding the complex dynamics of whiteness and its impact on social relationships. The book synthesizes insights from critical whiteness studies, intersectionality theory, and psychoanalytic thought to explain the four primary ways in which whiteness operates in today's world.

*Memory, Film and Medievalism*

<br>

Academics often assume that non-specialists know little about the Middle Ages, but the truth is more complex. This book explores how popular culture shapes our understanding of medieval history through what the author calls "medievalisms" - post-medieval interpretations of the medieval world that range from Lord of the Rings to Game of Thrones. Based on extensive focus groups, the study reveals the intricate ways that formal and informal learning about the medieval past influence our collective memory and why this matters for historians and filmmakers alike.
