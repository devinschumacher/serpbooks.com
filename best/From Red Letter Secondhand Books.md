*The Decline and Fall of Truth in Bush's America*

<br>

On September 11, 2001, as America reeled from the deadliest attack in its history, a new president rose to power promising vengeance against those who sought to destroy the nation he loved. What followed was not just a war against terrorism, but a shadow conflict within the halls of power itself - a struggle for truth in an era where facts became optional and reality itself was rewritten by the stroke of a pen. Through meticulous documentation and unflinching analysis, New York Times columnist Frank Rich exposes the inner workings of a propaganda machine that turned legitimate fear into political weapons, and how the guardians of truth - the news media - fell silent in the face of brilliant manipulation. This is the true story of how a nation came to doubt its own eyes, and the courageous few who fought to restore honor to American discourse in the shadow of 9/11.
