## [Obfuscation in Competitive Markets](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Obfuscation+in+Competitive+Markets?i=stripbooks)

<br>

In competitive markets, product complexity through add-ons can obscure true value, leading to higher prices and reduced buyer welfare. This experimental study examines how firms strategically use obfuscation to maintain profit margins while buyers struggle to find the best deals, often settling for more expensive options due to the time and effort required for thorough comparison. The research highlights the instability of purely exploitative obfuscation strategies and the importance of surplus-enhancing features in sustaining complex product markets.
