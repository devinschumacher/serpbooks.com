*A Novel*

<br>

In this brilliant debut novel set during the 1965 Watts Riots, A. G. Lombardo tells the story of Americo Monk, a graffiti enthusiast navigating through the chaotic streets of Los Angeles to reach his home in a makeshift harbor community. As Monk encounters an eclectic mix of characters including Chinese gangsters, witches, and leaders of the Nation of Islam, this allegorical tale reveals the hidden subcultures that formed the backbone of 1960s LA. Through its innovative blend of street walls and bound pages, "Graffiti Palace" becomes both a literary work and a historical document of a city in revolt.

*Performing Feminism in the Hip Hop Diaspora*

<br>

Since the late 1960s, graffiti has evolved from street walls to bound pages in Jessica Nydia Pabón-Colón's groundbreaking work, "Graffiti Grrlz. " This scholarly examination shines a spotlight on over 100 women artists across 23 countries, demonstrating how they've transformed graffitia from a "boys club" to a global feminist movement.

Through meticulous research and engaging storytelling, this 276-page volume establishes graffiti as a powerful medium for youth performance and cultural expression, proving that anyone can play this once-anonymous game of street walls and bound pages.
