This groundbreaking work demonstrates how racial segregation in American cities creates and perpetuates black poverty. The authors show how deliberate segregation policies from the early 20th century have evolved into institutional practices and governmental policies that maintain hypersegregation today, despite legal protections. They argue that extreme racial isolation leads to underclass communities during economic downturns, as poverty becomes more concentrated and social conditions deteriorate. The book challenges the notion that race matters less in contemporary America, providing a historical and social analysis that links residential segregation to systemic black disadvantage.

*Spiritualism and Women's Rights in Nineteenth-Century America*

<br>

"Radical Spirits" by Ann Braude uncovers the surprising collaboration between the nascent women's rights movement and Spiritualism, highlighting the profound impact these concurrent developments left on American social and religious history. Drawing from meticulously chosen case studies and historical records, Braude demonstrates how women's spiritual explorations frequently paved the way for their political advocacy, offering fresh perspectives on women's history. The book also traces the enduring influence of this spiritual-feminist partnership on later scholarship, making a powerful argument for religion's continued significance in women's rights and social change discussions.
