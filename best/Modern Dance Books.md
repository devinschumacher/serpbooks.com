*Performing Change in Postwar America*

In postwar America, modern dance artists faced significant risks when expressing dissent from the mainstream anticommunist culture.

The book examines the work of prominent choreographers including Martha Graham, José Limón, and Merce Cunningham, among others, highlighting the power of dance to influence real-world perceptions and attitudes.
