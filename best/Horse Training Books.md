*Beyond Natural Horsemanship: Horse Training's New Frontier*

<br>

In this groundbreaking work, German equestrian expert Andrea Kutsch presents a revolutionary approach to horse training that transforms conventional methods into a sophisticated system of equine communication. Drawing from her extensive experience at The Lewitz Stud and Paul Schockemöhle's renowned training facilities, Kutsch develops Evidence-Based Equine Communication (EBEC) - a practical framework that deciphers horse behavior, explains the psychological foundations of learning, and establishes a new reward-punishment model grounded in operant conditioning from the horse's perspective. This meticulously researched book challenges traditional assumptions about horse training, offering riders and trainers a comprehensive toolkit to enhance their partnership with equine companions.
