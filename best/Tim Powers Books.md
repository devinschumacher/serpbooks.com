<br>

In this masterful collection of twenty science fiction tales, two-time World Fantasy and Philip K. Dick Award winner Tim Powers blends supernatural wonder with dark humor. The anthology features Powers' acclaimed story "The Bible Repairman, " where a psychic handyman removes troublesome Biblical passages for clients, only to face his own broken soul when rescuing the ghost of a kidnapped daughter. In "Salvage and Demolition, " a down-and-out book collector discovers a lost manuscript that transports him back to 1950s San Francisco, where he must prevent an ancient Sumeric inscription from dooming millions in the future. The collection ranges from the heart-wrenching "Down and Out in Purgatory, " where a man's soul seeks vengeance against his lover's killer, to the darkly comic "Sufficient unto the Day, " when a Thanksgiving feast goes horribly wrong, drawing soul-stealing demons into the family television set. These pulse-pounding stories showcase Powers' unique storytelling gifts and his profound understanding of how human destiny unfolds in the shadow of supernatural forces.
