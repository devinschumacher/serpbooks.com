*Triumph and Tears at the Judgment Seat of Christ*

<br>

In this thought-provoking work, Dr. Erwin Lutzer examines the biblical foundations of how believers will be judged and rewarded in heaven. Drawing from often-overlooked Scriptures, the book explores the practical implications of living faithfully on earth, where "what is sown is reaped" in the eternal realm. Through careful exegesis and practical application, Lutzer reminds readers that their actions, words, and use of resources now will directly impact their experience of heaven later.
