*Reading English Cooking at Home and Abroad*

<br>

This scholarly collection examines English cooking practices from 1550 to 1800, revealing how kitchen activities were integral to early modern food cultures. Through literary and historical analysis, the essays explore how cooking bridged domestic life with broader social, economic, and political contexts. The volume highlights the kitchen's role in producing, processing, and preserving food while also nurturing connections to local and global surroundings. By integrating close reading with recipe analysis and considering factors like gender, class, and colonialism, the authors develop a theoretical framework that connects the physical act of cooking with its intellectual, social, and historical implications.
