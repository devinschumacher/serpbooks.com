*How Woke Policies Are Destroying Our Military*

<br>

In her powerful new book, former U. S. Army combat helicopter pilot Amber Smith reveals how woke policies are transforming our military from a lethal fighting force to a dysfunctional bureaucracy obsessed with identity politics and leftist ideology. Drawing from her experience as a Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, Smith exposes the dangerous consequences of lowering military standards for the sake of diversity and political correctness. Unfit to Fight sounds the alarm that if we don't return to a merit-based system focused on combat readiness and leadership trust, we risk losing not just battles, but our national security in the process.
