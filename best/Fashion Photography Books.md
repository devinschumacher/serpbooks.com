*The Secret, Sexy, Sometimes Sordid World of Fashion Photographers*

<br>

Fashion photographers sold not only clothes but ideals of beauty and visions of perfect lives.

He takes you behind the scenes of revolutionary creative processes--and the private passions--of these visionary magicians.

*A Century of Fashion Photography*

<br>

Fashion photography evolved dramatically over the 20th century, as this pivotal moment in 1911 demonstrates: French publisher Lucien Vogel challenged Edward Steichen to create the first artistic fashion photographs, marking a decisive shift from mere documentation to creative expression. The following decades saw landmark developments by photographers like Martin Munkácsi, Richard Avedon, and Helmut Newton, who progressively redefined the genre's boundaries through innovative techniques and conceptual approaches. As digital technology transformed the field in the late 20th century, trailblazers such as Inez & Vinoodh and Mert & Marcus continued to push the envelope, establishing new norms for fashion imagery that continue to influence the industry today. This meticulously illustrated survey examines these evolution through five chronological chapters, featuring over 300 photographs by fashion photography's most influential practitioners alongside original costumes and fashion illustrations that shaped the genre's development.
