In this groundbreaking study, Jay Price examines the evolution of American religious architecture from the 1940s through the 1970s, revealing how a coalition of denominational bureaus, architects, and religious organizations shaped sacred spaces during one of the nation's largest building booms.

Through detailed analysis of projects across Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish traditions, Price demonstrates how these architects transcended ethnic and regional boundaries to craft environments that honored the divine while addressing the practical needs of modern worship.
