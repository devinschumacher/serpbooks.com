*Basic Income and Stakeholder Grants as Cornerstones for an Egalitarian Capitalism*

<br>

Redesigning Distribution presents two innovative proposals to make capitalism more egalitarian without compromising its productivity and growth. The first, by Philippe van Parijs, advocates for an unconditional basic income that provides all citizens with a no-frills but adequate standard of living. The second, discussed by Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott, proposes substantial one-time grants to all young adults, financed by an annual wealth tax. Together, these ideas aim to eliminate poverty and ensure a fair starting point for all in an affluent society.
