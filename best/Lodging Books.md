<br>

In this meticulously researched work, historian Joseph O'Neill lifts the lid on a hidden world of Victorian society that existed just beyond the reach of polite conversation. Through the portal of the lodging house, we meet an extraordinary cast of characters: criminals and artists, immigrants and orphans, all rubbing shoulders in these bustling hubs of human trafficking. More than just sleeping quarters for London's forgotten people, these lodging houses served as waystations for an entire underclass of individuals on the move - from street corners to railway stations, from debtor's prison to the workhouse. In 195 pages of meticulously documented history, O'Neill reveals how these institutions shaped the lives of ordinary people caught in the web of Victorian social and legal systems.
