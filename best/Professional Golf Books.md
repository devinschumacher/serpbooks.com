*How Charlie Sifford and Stanley Mosk Integrated the PGA*

<br>

In 1959, an unlikely alliance formed between Charlie Sifford, the first Black golfer to earn his PGA card, and Stanley Mosk, the Attorney General of California who would later serve on the state Supreme Court. Their chance meeting at a Los Angeles country club sparked a legal and social battle that would transform professional golf. As Sifford fought to compete alongside white players and Mosk took on the PGA's discriminatory by-laws, their personal journeys converged to change the face of a sport long shadowed by racial injustice. This compelling narrative shines a light on a pivotal moment in golf history, where courage and legal acumen collided to integrate a profession that had resisted change for decades.
