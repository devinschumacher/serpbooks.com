*Cross-Dressing, Law, and Fascination in Nineteenth-Century San Francisco*

<br>

In 1863, San Francisco's Board of Supervisors passed a law criminalizing the act of appearing in public dressed as the opposite sex. This legal provision became part of a wider anti-indecency campaign and led to over one hundred arrests before the century's end. As similar laws emerged in forty U. S. cities, they transformed from courtroom regulations to cultural phenomena, shaping public perceptions of gender normality and abnormality. Through detailed archival research, Clare Sears examines how these legal frameworks intersected with popular culture, influencing everything from newspaper scandals to vaudevillian performances, while also highlighting the resilience of those who continued to defy these restrictive regulations.

![What Did Jesus Look Like? | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/B5g8DwAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

"What Did Jesus Look Like? " challenges the conventional image of Jesus as a handsome, white man with flowing hair and pristine robes. Leading Christian scholar Joan E. Taylor examines historical evidence and artistic depictions to present a more accurate vision of Jesus, suggesting that he may have had short hair and looked quite different from the traditional portrayals that dominate Christian art and culture. This 288-page book offers a fascinating exploration of how Jesus's appearance has been shaped by centuries of artistic interpretation and what the latest historical research reveals about the man behind the icon.
