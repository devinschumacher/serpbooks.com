*Creating Knowledge and Healing in the Early Modern Atlantic*

In this groundbreaking work, Pablo F. Gomez reveals how Caribbean people of color developed sophisticated healing practices based on sensorial experience rather than dogma.

The book highlights over 100 black ritual practitioners who served as masters of healing and spiritual leaders, showing how their experiential knowledge not only responded to the ills of slavery but also shaped the broader early modern world.
