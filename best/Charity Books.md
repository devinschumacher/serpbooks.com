*How the Nonprofit Community Can Stand Up For Itself and Really Change the World*

<br>

Charity Case presents a bold vision for transforming America's nonprofit sector through the creation of a national Charity Defense Council. Author Dan Pallotta, a pioneer in multi-day charity events, argues that our current "give now, ask questions later" approach to philanthropy undermines charities' ability to solve pressing social issues. He proposes concrete steps to re-educate the public about giving, including building an anti-defamation league, launching a national ad campaign, and enacting a Civil Rights Act for charity and social enterprise. This practical blueprint empowers the nonprofit community to stand up for itself and achieve its full potential in tackling society's greatest challenges.

*How Churches and Charities Hurt Those They Help (And How to Reverse It)*

<br>

In this groundbreaking guide, veteran urban activist Robert D. Lupton reveals how well-meaning charitable actions often produce unintended, detrimental effects on the communities they aim to help. Drawing from four decades of firsthand experience in urban ministry, Lupton exposes the dark side of American compassion: how free food and clothing distributions erode dignity and increase dependency, why neighborhood beautification projects conducted by outsiders strip residents of their sense of responsibility, and how short-term mission trips inadvertently turn local populations into beggars. The book presents a compelling case for transforming toxic charity into thoughtful community development, offering practical strategies and real-world examples of compassionate service that produces deep, lasting change. Lupton challenges readers to move beyond spontaneous acts of generosity toward informed, effective approaches to helping others, concluding with a powerful "Oath for Compassionate Service" that redefines what it means to serve marginalized communities.

*The Place of the Poor in the Biblical Tradition*

In this scholarly examination of charity within the biblical tradition, Gary A.

This work offers both religious scholars and general readers a thoughtful perspective on how cultivating compassion can lead to a deeper understanding of God and humanity's place in the world.
