Over the last 40 years, linguistic typology has revealed that every language allows for various word-order constructions, with some patterns considered basic and others marked. Moshavi's study examines word order in classical Biblical Hebrew finite clauses, focusing on preposing constructions where elements are placed before the verb. Through contextual analysis of Genesis, she categorizes most preposed clauses as either focusing or topicalization constructions, demonstrating how these syntactic forms convey pragmatic meaning.

*Architects of a New City*

<br>

In this meticulously researched biography, Adina Hoffman chronicles the lives of three architects who shaped modern Jerusalem. The narrative begins with Erich Mendelsohn's 1934 arrival from Nazi Germany, continues with the Byzantine and Islamic architectural traditions of Austen St. Barbe Harrison, and concludes with the forgotten genius of Spyro Houris, whose Armenian-tile buildings stand as testament to Jerusalem's cultural fluidity. Through these intimate portraits, Hoffman excavates the layers of history that have shaped one of the world's most complex cities.

*A Graphic History*

<br>

In 1876, a young West African woman named Abina stood before a British court, fighting for her freedom against an empire that threatened to destroy everything she held dear. Through meticulous recreation of the original court transcript, this groundbreaking graphic history follows Abina's courageous journey as she argues her case in front of a panel of "important men"--a British judge, two Euro-African attorneys, a wealthy African gentleman, and a jury of local leaders. As the pages turn, readers witness the raw power of a legal battle that shook the foundations of colonial rule, told through the brilliant illustrations of Liz Clarke and the historical expertise of Trevor R. Getz. This compelling story marks a crucial moment in history when an enslaved woman's fight for justice became a powerful statement against an unjust system.

Through meticulous curation, these seemingly discarded documents were transformed from sacred trash to living treasure, offering an intimate window into medieval Jewish life through their remarkable collection of personal and religious manuscripts.
