*The Women Who Dared to Rule*

<br>

In this groundbreaking work, historian Katherine Pangonis reveals the previously untold story of a dynasty of royal women who ruled in the Crusader States of Outremer. Centering on Queen Sibylla's desperate defense of Jerusalem against Saladin's armies in 1187, the narrative unfolds through three generations of Armenian-Christian queens who wielded remarkable political and military power in the medieval Middle East. From Sibylla's grandmother Melisende, who pioneered female rule in Jerusalem, to her own determined leadership during the city's darkest hour, these pages chronicle a series of women who commanded armies, conducted diplomacy, and shaped the fate of nations. Their stories of rebellion, alliances, and architectural legacy challenge the notion that women in this period were mere figureheads, offering instead a rich revisionist history of medieval Palestine through the eyes of its most commanding queens and princesses.
