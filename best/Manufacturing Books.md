*A Tragedy of Sorcery and Superstition*

<br>

The Last Witches of England chronicles the tragic tale of three Bideford women condemned to hang as witches in 1682, marking the end of legal persecution for sorcery in England. Through meticulous research, John Callow reveals how their story evolved from local scandal to symbolic representation of wrongful accusation, influencing legal reforms and inspiring generations of women's rights advocates. This compelling narrative examines how societal beliefs about witchcraft persisted for over a century after their deaths, eventually transforming public perception from fear to celebration of these wrongfully persecuted individuals.
