*Studies in the Technique and Criticism of Painting*

What is Art? by John Charles Van Dyke delves into the heart of painting, exploring what makes a work truly excellent. Through careful analysis of famous artworks and artists, this influential book argues that beauty, harmony, and emotional expressiveness are the key criteria for evaluating paintings, rather than just realism or technical skill. Van Dyke's work stands as a classic in art criticism, selected by scholars for its cultural importance and preserved as part of our civilization's knowledge base.
