*Why the CEO Pay Experiment Failed and How to Fix It*

<br>

In the 1970s, corporate directors began supplementing CEOs' already generous salaries with stock options and bonuses, hoping to enhance company performance. Guided by unproven assumptions, this practice continues today despite empirical evidence showing it doesn't work. Michael Dorff's "Indispensable and Other Myths" explores how performance pay has failed to improve corporate results and why CEOs of large established companies rarely impact their organizations' success. Drawing from extensive studies, Dorff argues for returning to guaranteed salaries and abandoning the failed experiment of using compensation as a governance tool.
