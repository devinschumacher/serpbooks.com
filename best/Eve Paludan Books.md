<br>

Published in 1860, this influential work by Hinton Rowan Helper argues against slavery from a uniquely economic perspective. Rather than appealing to ethical considerations, Helper presents a detailed case against slavery based on its detrimental impact on the Southern economy. He contends that slavery stifled industrial development and economic progress, explaining why the South lagged behind the North since the late 18th century. Through careful analysis and logical argumentation, this 224-page volume offers a compelling reminder of the economic folly of slavery and the urgent need for its abolition.

*Abraham Lincoln and the Great Secession Winter 1860-1861*

<br>

In the four months between Abraham Lincoln's election in November 1860 and his inauguration in March 1861, the president-elect faced unprecedented challenges that tested his leadership and commitment to preserving the Union. During this critical period, known as the Great Secession Winter, Lincoln rejected numerous compromise offers from Republicans and Democrats, Northerners and Southerners, that might have prevented civil war but would have allowed slavery to continue. Through carefully crafted public statements and private correspondence, Lincoln shaped public opinion and maintained the principle of majority rule, ensuring that his election marked the beginning of a new era in American history rather than the end of the Union.

*Race and the Making of the American Working Class*

In this groundbreaking work, David Roediger combines classical Marxism, psychoanalysis, and the new labor history to examine the origins of working-class racism in the United States. Drawing from the pioneering research of E. P. Thompson and Herbert Gutman, the book reveals how white workers developed racial identities that set them apart from Black counterparts, challenging the notion that economic advantage alone explains this historical phenomenon. Through 241 pages of insightful analysis, Roediger demonstrates the complex ideological and psychological mechanisms that have shaped American working-class consciousness around race.
