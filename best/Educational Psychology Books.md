When this seminal work was first published in 1926, L. S. Vygotsky was establishing himself as a prominent Russian intellectual. His groundbreaking study of educational psychology revolutionized the field by positioning the child as the central figure in the learning process, while emphasizing the teacher's role in facilitating rather than directing education. This classic text remains highly influential in understanding the psychological foundations of education and continues to shape educational practices worldwide.
