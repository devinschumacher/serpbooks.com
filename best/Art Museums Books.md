*Art Museums and the Politics of Culture in Nineteenth-century France*

Attracting controversy as readily as crowds, art museums occupy a curious but central position in world culture. Through an exploration of provincial French museums in the nineteenth century, this original study reveals how local elites shaped these institutions from repositories of confiscated art to monumental expressions of bourgeois leadership. The author examines the museums of Bordeaux, Dijon, Marseilles, and Rouen as case studies of how municipal art collections evolved alongside regional exhibitions and government initiatives, offering insights into the political and social forces that continue to influence cultural institutions today.

Based on the 1985 Survey of Public Participation in the Arts, this study examines who visits American art museums and galleries, looking at factors like income, education, and cultural background.

The report also explores why some people don't visit museums, comparing the demographics of museum-goers to those of the general population.

Comic art made its debut in museums as far back as 1930, but it wasn't until the mid-1960s that these institutions began to embrace the medium seriously. This anthology traces the fascinating journey of comic art through museum exhibitions, from its early days of censorship and controversy to becoming a respected art form celebrated worldwide. Through essays and interviews with dozens of experts, the book explores how pop culture icons like Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein helped pave the way for comics to be viewed in an art historical context, leading to today's global appreciation of this once-underestimated medium.

*Art and Museums in an Age of Protest*

<br>

In this timely and insightful book, Laura Raicovich examines the evolving role of museums in the age of protest. Drawing from her experience as director of the Queens Museum, she explores how these institutions have become flashpoints for political and social change. Raicovich provides historical context for current controversies, showing how museums emerged as colonial institutions that perpetuated conservative values. Through thoughtful analysis of key events, including the resignation of Warren Kanders at the Whitney and protests against Israeli government events at the Queens Museum, she reveals the tension between artistic neutrality and the growing expectation that cultural institutions should serve public ends. The book offers valuable perspectives on how museums can be reinvented to better reflect and engage with the communities they serve.
