<br>

In this groundbreaking work, historian Jon Cowans examines how popular cinema shaped Western attitudes toward colonialism from 1946 to 1959. Drawing from over one hundred British, French, and American films, the study reveals how cinema portrayed the complexities of colonial rule and its impact on both colonizers and subjects. While some films defended empire, many "liberal colonialist" productions undermined support for colonial policies, with a few advocating openly for decolonization. The book analyzes the genre's treatment of interracial relationships and "internal colonialism, " showing how these themes played out in everything from "The King and I" to lesser-known works. Through careful analysis of production, imagery, and reception, Cowans demonstrates how cinema influenced public opinion on decolonization, making this the first truly transnational history of cinema's role in the collapse of empire.

*An Environmental History of the Conquest of California and Hawai'i*

<br>

In the 19th century, the American West expanded far beyond its traditional boundaries to encompass the Pacific territories of California and Hawai'i. This environmental history explores how the introduction of cattle transformed these regions, creating native cattle cultures represented by the Indian vaquero and Hawaiian paniolo. However, the story of progress and adaptation is tempered by the darker consequences of colonization, including land loss and demographic collapse among native populations. Through this trans-Pacific lens, historian John Ryan Fischer reveals the complex ecological and economic changes that reshaped two distinct Pacific frontiers.

*Colonialism and Public Culture in the Third Reich*

<br>

In this meticulously researched work, Willeke Sandler examines how German colonialist organizations shaped public culture during the Third Reich. Despite Germany's loss of overseas territories after World War I, groups like the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft and Reichskolonialbund promoted the idea of Germany as an "interrupted colonial power, " seeking to redefine the country's national identity through imperial ambitions. Their efforts, supported by extensive publicity campaigns, highlight the complex relationship between colonialism and Nazi territorial goals, revealing the dedicated advocacy for a renewed German empire in the face of international constraints and domestic ambivalence.

<br>

Max Liboiron's pioneering research recasts environmental science as a colonial endeavor that facilitates land theft and pollution. His work in Newfoundland, Canada, examines how scientific methods often reflect colonial perspectives, making Indigenous land accessible for settler objectives. Drawing from his role at the Civic Laboratory for Environmental Action Research (CLEAR), Liboiron develops an anticolonial scientific framework that prioritizes Indigenous land stewardship, ethical research practices, and community relations. This approach reveals plastic pollution not as a mere capitalist byproduct but as a direct consequence of colonial land management, providing practical alternatives for more responsible environmental science.
