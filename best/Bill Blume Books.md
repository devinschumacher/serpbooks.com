*How Ball Came to Build a Comet-Hunting Machine*

<br>

How did a company best known for its glass jars hit a comet 83 million miles away? "From Jars to the Stars" tells the remarkable story of Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. , which built the spacecraft that smashed into comet Tempel 1 as part of NASA's Deep Impact mission. Award-winning science journalist Todd Neff traces the roots of this aerospace giant back to a group of University of Colorado students who built a "sun seeker" for rocket noses, sparking the creation of both Ball Aerospace and the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics. The book charts Ball's evolution from building the Orbiting Solar Observatory in 1962 to crafting seven Hubble Space Telescope instruments, illustrating how American space exploration shifted from "gigabuck" missions to "faster, better, cheaper" spacecraft. Neff highlights the often rocky partnership between Ball Aerospace and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, showing that while the people behind these missions stay on the ground, their impact reaches far beyond Earth's atmosphere.
