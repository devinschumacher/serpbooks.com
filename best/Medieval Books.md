In the fourth century, the Roman Empire's senatorial nobility held sway over much of its territory, having risen through the grant of senatorial offices without the need to serve in the Senate or even reside in Rome. This hereditary caste included provincial leaders and government officials, transmitting their privileges to future generations. As Dana Munro illustrates in this 356-page historical account, the senatorial nobility represented not just a social elite but an aspirational order open to all who sought Imperial favor or distinction.

*Lacunae in Medieval Books*

<br>

In this groundbreaking work, Elina Gertsman challenges the prevailing notion that Gothic art abhors empty space, revealing instead a profound engagement with the unrepresentable. Through a meticulous examination of medieval philosophical and scientific thought, she demonstrates how artists of the later Middle Ages innovatively employed emptiness, voids, and erasures to depict the invisible forces of creation and death. The Absent Image stands as a significant contribution to our understanding of how medieval visual culture grappled with the concept of nothingness, offering both art historians and scientists a fresh perspective on the period's most complex iconic challenges.
