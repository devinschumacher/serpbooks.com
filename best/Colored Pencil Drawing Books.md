When a troubled young man named Billy walks into Cormoran Strike's office, he ignites an investigation that will lead the private eye through the dark underbelly of London and beyond. As Strike and his former assistant, now partner, Robin Ellacott piece together the fragments of Billy's story, they uncover a web of secrets that threatens to upend everything they thought they knew about their own partnership. While the case draws them deeper into a world of political intrigue and danger, Strike must also navigate the complicated landscape of his growing relationship with Robin. In the fourth installment of the Strike series, Robert Galbraith weaves a masterful tale of detection and deception that will keep readers guessing until the very end.
