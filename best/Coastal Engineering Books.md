<br>

This technical report describes a unique U-tube water tunnel designed to generate sinusoidal flow with peak velocities ranging from 0 to 30 centimeters per second and periods between 3 to 25 seconds. The tunnel features two vertical cylinders with tight-fitting pistons driven by a variable-speed motor, allowing for precise control of flow characteristics. An adjustable counterweight system enables resonant operation across the full range of periods, making this setup particularly valuable for coastal engineering studies and fluid dynamics research.
