In the gritty sixteenth installment of Pippa DaCosta's 1000 Revolution series, Caleb and his crew face their biggest challenge yet. Hounded by the law and every criminal in the Nine systems, they hole up in the rough-and-tumble spaceport of Jotunheim. With their tugship Starkiller on its last legs and credits running low, they turn to their darkest tactic: raiding the scrapers' rigs. But when synthetic soldiers begin to stir among the stars, their personal vendettas pale in comparison to the war brewing across the galaxy. Against a backdrop of neon-lit space stations and dangerous alliances, Resistance weaves themes of trust, identity, and the thin line between heroism and chaos. It's a pulse-pounding ride through a universe where the rules are rewritten with every jump between the stars.
