*The Whole Earth Catalog and American Environmentalism*

<br>

In the 1960s, a small group of San Francisco hippies led by Stewart Brand transformed a local newsletter into The Whole Earth Catalog, a groundbreaking publication that would become a national phenomenon. Billing itself as "Access to Tools, " the Catalog gave birth to a philosophy of pragmatic environmentalism that celebrated technological achievement, human ingenuity, and sustainable living. Through meticulous research, Andrew Kirk traces the evolution of this counterculture green movement from its origins in the Point Foundation to its influence on modern environmentalism, showing how Brand and his cohorts turned radical ideas into actionable solutions. The book reveals the Catalog's role in shaping everything from Al Gore's environmental views to our understanding of appropriate technology, making a compelling case for why staying home and modifying your toilet can be more effective than political protest.

*Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the Rise of Digital Utopianism*

<br>

In the 1960s, computers symbolized the cold war's rigid organization and mechanical conformity. By the 1990s, they represented a collaborative digital utopia, thanks to a group of San Francisco Bay Area entrepreneurs led by Stewart Brand. Through venues like the Whole Earth Catalog and Wired magazine, Brand brokered a collaboration between counterculturalists and technologists that transformed computers from tools of conformity to instruments of personal liberation and community building. This historical account spans the emergence of computer conferencing systems and virtual communities, revealing how the distance between the Grateful Dead and Google is not as great as we might think.

*Alternative Arts and Social Transformation in Authoritarian Brazil*

<br>

In this groundbreaking history, Christopher Dunn reveals how Brazil's military dictatorship inadvertently fostered a vibrant counterculture during the turbulent 1960s and 1970s. As hardline forces ascended within the regime, a generation of urban, middle-class Brazilians drew inspiration from international counterculture movements, infusing local art, literature, and music with revolutionary ideas about race, gender, and citizenship. The story reaches its crescendo in Bahia, where youth seeking spiritual alternatives converged to create a unique cultural hub. Through meticulous research and vivid storytelling, Dunn demonstrates how these countercultural seeds blossomed into Brazil's most influential social and justice movements, offering an intimate window into a crucial chapter of Brazilian history.
