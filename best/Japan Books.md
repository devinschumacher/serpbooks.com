*An Attempt at Interpretation*

<br>

In 1889, Lafcadio Hearn arrived in Japan as a Western journalist and fell in love with the nation and its people, inspiring him to write a series of essays that would help introduce Japanese culture to the rest of the world. Published in 1904, this collection presents an early attempt by a non-Japanese writer to understand and interpret the "outward strangeness" of all things Japanese, capturing the essence of a country that was just beginning to open up to the West. Through his lyrical prose, Hearn conveys not just the observable aspects of Japanese life but the deeper cultural and spiritual beliefs that shape the nation and its people.

*How Japan Created Its Own Lost Generation*

<br>

In this insightful exploration, Michael Zielenziger examines how Japan's economic collapse in the early 1990s gave rise to a generation of young people withdrawing from society. The book focuses on two major social phenomena: hikikomori, young men who isolate themselves in their rooms, and parasite singles, single women who refuse to leave home, marry, or have children. Through these stories, Zielenziger reveals how Japan's tradition-steeped society and aversion to change are stifling economic revival and social progress, offering a compelling look at the country's stagnation and its global implications.
