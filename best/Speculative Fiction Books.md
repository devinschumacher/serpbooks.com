<br>

In this thought-provoking work, literary critic Sherryl Vint examines how twenty-first-century speculative fiction grapples with the commodification of life through biotechnology. Drawing from both fictional narratives and real-world examples, the book explores how biotechnology is reshaping fundamental concepts of personhood, agency, and value within a neoliberal framework. Vint's analysis spans the intersection of biological function and economic interest, revealing the limitations of traditional human rights frameworks in addressing these emerging biopolitical issues. The book concludes with a posthumanist reevaluation of life's value that extends beyond capitalist logics, offering a timely perspective on ecological relations in the age of biocapital.
