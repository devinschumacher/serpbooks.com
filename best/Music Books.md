*Jazz and Black Music 1955-1965*

<br>

Between 1955 and 1965, jazz underwent a remarkable transformation as a generation of young black musicians fused bebop'sTechnical virtuosity with R&B'sraw emotional power, giving birth to hard bop. This groundbreaking style found its home in the crowded, smoke-filled clubs of the era, where tenor saxophonists like Jackie McLean and Tina Brooks carved out their distinctive voices alongside the more lyrical trumpeting of Art Farmer and the innovative compositions of Benny Golson. As the movement evolved, it absorbed everything from Gospel to Debussy, reaching its zenith with albums like Miles Davis'sKind of Blueand Charles Mingus'sMingus Ah Um. Through meticulous analysis of the period's most influential recordings, Rosenthal captures not only theTechnical brilliance of these musicians but the cultural significance of their work, which continues to influence jazz and black music to this day.
