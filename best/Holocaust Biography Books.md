## [The Myth of Judicial Independence](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/The+Myth+of+Judicial+Independence?i=stripbooks)

![The Myth of Judicial Independence | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/oTjpDwAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

The Myth of Judicial Independence examines how the English judiciary developed the Judges' Rules for police interrogation in secret collaboration with the executive, misleading parliament about their true origins. Through archival research, authors Mike McConville and Luke Marsh reveal that these foundational legal principles depend more on common law traditions of adversarial process and trial by jury than on abstract "rule of law" concepts. The book challenges conventional wisdom about judicial independence, suggesting that contemporary criminal justice practices may reflect ideological preferences rather than legal fundamentals.
