*Engineers and the Controlled Environment, 1900-1960*

<br>

Air-conditioning America traces the slow adoption of air conditioning in the United States from 1900 to 1960. Despite the invention of both window and central air conditioning systems, many Americans initially resisted these innovations in favor of traditional outdoor cooling methods like fans, cold drinks, and light clothing. Using historical examples ranging from rooftop schoolrooms to open-air theaters, author Gail Cooper highlights the social and cultural challenges that air conditioning faced as it sought to replace centuries-old cooling techniques with modern climate control systems.
