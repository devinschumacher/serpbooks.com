*Britain's Collusion with Radical Islam*

<br>

In this meticulously updated edition of "Secret Affairs, " Mark Curtis exposes Britain's clandestine dealings with radical Islamic groups, spanning from the aftermath of Mubarak's fall in Egypt to the disturbing origins of the Manchester bomber, Salman Abedi. The book revelations include Britain's failed attempts to rehabilitate the Muslim Brotherhood, its controversial military intervention in Libya alongside pro-al-Qaeda forces, and its continued reliance on Saudi Arabia to protect its Middle Eastern interests. Drawing from previously unreported events and government documents, Curtis traces a covert history of British collusion with militant groups stretching back to the 1940s, where these strategic alliances have repeatedly prioritized control over oil resources and regime change above all else.
