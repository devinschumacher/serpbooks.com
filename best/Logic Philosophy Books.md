<br>

In "Varieties of Logic, " Stewart Shapiro explores logical pluralism and relativism, arguing that different logics can be equally valid. He examines how mathematical theories using non-classical logics become inconsistent when forced into a classical framework, suggesting that logical terminology's meaning shifts depending on the theoretical context. Shapiro defends his position against existing arguments and relates his findings to broader questions about relativism and foundational studies, demonstrating that managing multiple logical systems is both feasible and illuminating.

In this rigorous philosophical examination, Dale Jacquette challenges conventional wisdom about the nature of logic and its relationship to language and reality. By scrutinizing fundamental aspects of propositional and predicate-quantificational logic, Jacquette exposes several historically entrenched misconceptions that have shaped modern logical theory. His analysis encompasses truth functionality, metaphysical aspects of reference and predication, and the role of truth in meaning theory, ultimately offering a refined perspective on these foundational logical concepts.
