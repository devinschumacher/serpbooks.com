## [Questioning Paul](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Questioning+Paul?i=stripbooks)

*Devil's Advocate*

<br>

In "Questioning Paul: Devil's Advocate, " Craig Winn presents a compelling case against Paul's interpretations of Yahowah's revelations. Drawing from Deuteronomy 13:1-6, Winn argues that Paul's claims of performing miracles and promoting the worship of Iesou Christo contradict the Towrah's teachings. The book challenges readers to examine whether Paul's teachings truly affirm our love for Yahowah and leads us to a beneficial relationship with Him, or if they instead scatter us from the path of righteousness.
