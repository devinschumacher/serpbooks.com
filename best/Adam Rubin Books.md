*Thinking for Yourself in an Age of Unreason*

<br>

In "Don't Burn This Book, " Dave Rubin offers a provocative roadmap for free thinking in an age of increasing censorship. Drawing from his experiences hosting The Rubin Report, YouTube's most-watched talk show about free speech and big ideas, Rubin equips readers with the tools to form their own opinions on today's most controversial issues. The book defends classical liberal principles and provides a counterpoint to the progressive "woke" culture that threatens to silence dissenting voices. Through compelling arguments and personal anecdotes, Rubin demonstrates why checking facts, not privilege, should guide our thinking on everything from climate change to hate crimes. This work stands as a comprehensive response to the political and cultural shifts that have left many feeling homeless in their own ideological landscape.

*Sonic Marvels, Evolution's Creativity and the Crisis of Sensory Extinction*

<br>

In this lyrical exploration of Earth's acoustic wonders, biologist David Haskell weaves together the stories of how our planet's most remarkable sounds came to be. From rainforests alive with insect melody to the depths of the ocean, he reveals the evolutionary processes that shaped the diverse auditory landscape around us. Haskell shows how every chirp, call, and song is connected to the health of our environment, and why the silencing of these natural soundscapes threatens not just our ability to hear, but the very creativity and beauty of life on Earth. Through meticulous research and poetic prose, this work stands as both a celebration of nature's sonic marvels and a call to protect the increasingly fragile harmony of our planet's sounds.
