*A Prodigal's Journey Into the Love of God*

<br>

"A. K. A. Firewoman" is the compelling story of a former prodigal who transformed herself from a life of extreme rebellion to becoming a devoted part-time missionary and Bible student. Through her personal journey, Joyce Lynne shares how she went from being completely disconnected from God to realizing His unconditional love and forgiveness. This 124-page Christian publication offers profound insights into the nature of prodigals and provides hope for anyone who feels they've wandered too far to return to faith. It's a powerful testimony that demonstrates how quickly a life can change when met with the right kind of love and acceptance.
