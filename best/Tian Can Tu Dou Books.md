<br>

In this meticulously translated collection, Jacques Derrida presents his influential 1997 Cérisy conference address on "The Autobiographical Animal. " Drawing from ten hours of recorded sessions, this philosophical work examines how human thought has historically marginalized animal life through the Cartesian distinction between man and animal. Derrida's reflections, spanning from Descartes to Levinas, culminate in a poignant inquiry: what does an animal see when it encounters a naked human? This question anchors his broader critique of industrialized animal treatment and challenges conventional notions of "life" that have shaped Western philosophical thought.

*Chinese Political Thought of the Warring States Period*

"Envisioning Eternal Empire" by Yuri Pines examines the intellectual foundations of China's imperial system, tracing how Warring States period thinkers developed the ideological underpinnings of the empire that would last from 221 BCE to 1911 CE. Through analysis of classical texts and archaeological discoveries, Pines shows how these early philosophers' ideas about governance and social order were "preplanned" long before the imperial era, distinguishing China's political culture from other historical empires.

In this meticulously illustrated study, Sylvia Huot reveals how thirteenth- and fourteenth-century French poets bridged the gap between oral performance and written text.

Through close analysis of manuscript organization, page layout, and illumination, she shows how medieval writers and book-makers collaboratively shaped the vernacular book, with particular attention to the roles of poet, singer, and reader in these transformative works.
