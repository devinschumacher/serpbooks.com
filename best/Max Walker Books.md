*Doing Time in Jail*

<br>

"Indefinite" offers an intimate glimpse into the reality of American jails through the author's firsthand experience. Confinement in a southern California county jail system becomes the backdrop for an organic ethnography that explores the complex dynamics between deputies and residents, the strategies inmates use to cope with their emotional vulnerability, and the broader implications of penal time. This pioneering study stands as the first major ethnographic examination of jails since the era of racialized mass incarceration began, weaving together personal narrative with theoretical insights that extend far beyond the prison walls.
