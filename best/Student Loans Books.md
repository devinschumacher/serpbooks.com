*A Novel*

<br>

In this ingenious debut novel, Kiese Laymon weaves together two powerful stories set in post-Katrina Mississippi. The first follows Citoyen "City" Coldson, a young contestant who becomes an overnight YouTube sensation after a televised quiz meltdown, and is sent to Melahatchie to stay with his grandmother. There, he discovers a mysterious book called Long Division, which leads him to a breathtaking journey through time. The second story unfolds in 1985, where a version of City Coldson and his friend Shalaya Crump find themselves traveling back to 1964 to protect their family from the Ku Klux Klan. As these narratives intertwine, Laymon masterfully explores themes of celebrity, violence, and religious tension, highlighting the profound impact of history on young Black Americans.
