This seminar paper examines British Petroleum's strategic evolution from a traditional oil company to a diversified energy provider. The study centers on BP's landmark "Beyond Petroleum" campaign, launched in the late 1990s to address environmental concerns and unify the company's messaging following significant mergers and acquisitions. The campaign's dual objectives of showcasing BP as a green industry leader and consolidating its corporate identity earned two PRWeek Campaign of the Year awards in 2001, though it faced criticism from environmental organizations for perceived greenwashing. The paper offers valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of repositioning a major oil company in a changing energy landscape.
