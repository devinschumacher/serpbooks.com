In this authoritative study sponsored by the U. S. Office of Rural Health Policy, Thomas C. Ricketts examines the significant disparities in healthcare delivery between rural and metropolitan areas. The book reveals that while 25% of the population resides in rural regions, only 12.5% of doctors practice there, leading to critical shortages and limited access to care for the 61 million rural residents. Through comprehensive analysis of government programs, maps, graphs, and clear descriptions, Ricketts illustrates the challenges of providing adequate healthcare in less populated areas, highlighting the uneven distribution of medical resources and the impact of reimbursement policies on rural health services.

<br>

In "New Deal Medicine, " physician and historian Michael Grey examines the Farm Security Administration's rural health programs through archival records and oral histories from the 1930s and 1940s. While these programs served as a precursor to modern medical organization, they also faced intense political scrutiny as a form of "socialized medicine. " Grey evaluates the compromises made to provide healthcare for the poor without antagonizing conservative politicians and the American Medical Association, highlighting the complex interplay between medical innovation and political resistance that shaped the future of healthcare in both the United States and Canada.
