*An Interpretivist Guide*

<br>

In this interpretivist guide, Frederic Charles Schaffer presents a practical approach to working with social science concepts that challenges the traditional positivist project of concept reconstruction. Through a method he calls elucidation, which involves grounding, locating, and exposing concepts within specific language games and structures of power, Schaffer demonstrates how to situate abstract ideas in the context of daily life and social practice. Using clear examples from the concepts of person, family, and democracy, this concise 134-page book illustrates how to analyze and understand social science concepts in a way that reveals their embeddedness in particular times, places, and power structures, making it an essential resource for social science research and interpretation.

*Battles over Public Funding for the "Other Sciences" at the National Science Foundation*

<br>

In the early years of the Cold War, the U. S. government created the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support civilian scientific research. Initially focused on the natural sciences, the agency's enabling legislation included a vague reference to "other sciences, " which soon opened the door to social science funding. This decision sparked ongoing debates about the scientific status and social relevance of the social sciences within the NSF's mission. Mark Solovey's book examines how the NSF became a significant, though contentious, patron for social science research, shaping the field's development and public perception.

In this insightful work, Dipankar Sinha examines the evolving role of social sciences in the global age, highlighting the discipline's potential to resist neoliberal constraints on academic freedom and radical expression. The book critiques the fusion of economic conditionalities with academic parameters that threaten to homogenize social science knowledge, while also analyzing the internal contradictions and challenges faced by social scientists today. Through a theoretically grounded approach that avoids simplistic binary oppositions, "The Social Sciences in a Global Age" offers both established researchers and aspiring academics a valuable perspective on maintaining the humanistic core of social sciences in an increasingly complex world.
