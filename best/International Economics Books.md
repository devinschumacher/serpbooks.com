This collection brings together Peter Kenen's influential essays on international economics, covering trade theory, monetary policy, and international reserve management. The essays, written between 1957 and 1978, examine the determinants of trade patterns, the gains from international trade, and the challenges of balance of payments adjustment under different exchange rate regimes. Kenen, a leading figure in the field, also discusses the theoretical foundations of gold-exchange standards and the demand for international reserves, providing valuable insights into the evolution of international economic thought during this period.
