*Slavery and the Birth of The Frontier Romance*

<br>

The Making of Racial Sentiment explores how American frontier romances of the 1820s shaped modern ideas about racial differences. Through the works of James Fenimore Cooper, Lydia Maria Child, and others, Ezra Tawil shows how these popular novels described racial 'sentiment' - the notion that different races feel different things and feel things differently. By examining the sentimental aspects of white-Indian conflict novels, Tawil reveals their influence on later works like Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, demonstrating how early American literature helped define 'race' for an emerging national culture.
