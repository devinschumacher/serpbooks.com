<br>

Austenland follows a young New York woman named Jane who can't seem to find the right man in real life, perhaps because her heart belongs to Mr. Darcy, as played by Colin Firth in the BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. When a wealthy relative gifts her a trip to an English resort catering to Austen-obsessed women, Jane's fantasies of meeting her perfect Regency-era gentleman become more real than she ever imagined. What begins as a total immersion in a fake Austenland might just end with Jane finding the Mr. Darcy of her own, if she can learn to let go of her literary obsessions and open her heart to the possibilities of real life.
