*Mihaela's Journey*

<br>

In 1886, eleven-year-old Mihaela journeys from Croatia to Michigan's Copper Country with her mother and two brothers. Their father, an expert healer, had traveled ahead to work in the copper mines, but a painful eye disease leaves him vulnerable in this new land. Faced with numerous challenges, the family discovers their temporary visit will become permanent. Based on historical events and extensive research, this 72-page juvenile fiction book explores themes of sacrifice, assimilation, and cultural contribution through Mihaela's unique experience. The story highlights parallels between late 19th-century and modern immigrant experiences while teaching empathy and Michigan history.
