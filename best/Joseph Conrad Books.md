Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad's most famous novella, explores the dark heart of colonialism through the lens of his own experiences as a ship captain on the Congo River. Drawing from his voyage down the river and the illness that forced him to abandon his mission, Conrad crafts a powerful narrative that blurs the lines between fiction and autobiography. The story unfolds as the narrator travels deeper into the Congo, encountering characters that reflect both real historical figures and Conrad's artistic imagination. Through this carefully annotated and illustrated edition, readers can trace the geographical and biographical roots of the novella that helped establish Conrad as a master of literary impressionism.
