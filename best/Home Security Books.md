This book presents an integrated home security and safety system that combines face recognition, voice recognition, and health monitoring capabilities. The authors introduce PICA, a hybrid algorithm that merges PCA and ICA for improved biometric recognition, along with the MFRASTA voice recognition technique and a similarity index for trust-based security. The system continuously monitors the health of vulnerable individuals living alone and aids in emergency communication, demonstrating superior performance to existing methods through MATLAB-based testing and experimentation.
