This regional perspective examines how local scientists, aircraft engineers, and farmers developed more precise pesticide application methods and narrower chemical specificity to balance environmental concerns with crop protection needs. Their work links toxicology with environmental health, offering valuable insights into managing agricultural chemicals for both safety and effectiveness.
