*A Historical Perspective*

<br>

This historical account traces the study of novae from ancient civilizations to the 20th century, revealing how these "new stars" contributed to the birth of extragalactic astronomy. The narrative highlights key discoveries, including the thermonuclear nature of nova eruptions and the MMRD relation, while exploring the significant role novae play in the production of Type Ia supernovae.
