While tap dancers Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, and Eleanor Powell achieved major Hollywood stardom, and the Nicholas Brothers and Bill "Bojangles" Robinson received acclaim for their contributions to the genre, Black female tap dancers have historically received far less recognition for their pioneering work. This book rectifies that omission through interviews with numerous Black women tap dancers who performed on the most prominent American stages and were hailed by their male counterparts. Their stories highlight the unique challenges and achievements of Black women in what has traditionally been a male-dominated field.
