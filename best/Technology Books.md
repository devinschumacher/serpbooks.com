In 1963, a series of homemade bomb attacks rocked Montreal, marking the beginning of an eight-year revolutionary movement that would forever alter Quebec's political landscape. As a young cartoonist, Chris Oliveros delves into the untold saga of the Front de libération du Québec, where idealistic students and determined activists trained for armed revolt amidst their wealthy suburban neighborhood. Through meticulous research and comic artistry, Oliveros weaves together the true story of how this radical group evolved from fighting for workers' rights to attempting to overthrow the Canadian government, leaving their mark on both Quebec and Canadian politics.
