In 1924 Wilde City, private detective Buck Baxter navigates a landscape of romance and danger, where every night brings new mysteries and revelations about the human heart. As a man who's seen it all, Buck operates by strict rules: never make friends, never make enemies, and never fall in love. But when the charismatic Holden Hart walks into his life, Buck's carefully constructed world changes. From the illustrious Rainbow Palace atop the city tower to the shadowy depths of Hell's Bells convent, their story unfolds against a backdrop of opulence and intrigue that threatens to upend everything Buck Baxter thought he knew about love and loyalty.
