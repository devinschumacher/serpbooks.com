*A Feast for Lawyers*

<br>

In this unflinching expos√©, Sol Stein transforms his harrowing experience with Chapter 11 bankruptcy law into a damning indictment of a legal system that fails 70% of the businesses that seek its protection. Drawing from cases across trucking, food, real estate, oil, and publishing, this former CEO reveals how bankruptcy law enriches lawyers at the expense of creditors and debtor companies, echoing Dickens' "Bleak House" in its portrayal of a legal process that destroys far more than it saves.

*Bankruptcy and Consumer Credit in America*

<br>

Bankruptcy in America has become a widespread phenomenon, with hundreds of thousands of consumer filings each year. This multidisciplinary study examines the root causes of this legal boom, combining statistical analysis of court filings with intimate portraits of the debtors and creditors whose financial journeys have led them to bankruptcy court. The authors explore whether this trend reflects an increase in consumer debt or a broader moral shift that has made bankruptcy an acceptable middle-class option for debt resolution. Their findings offer both a quantitative overview of consumer bankruptcies and the human stories behind the legal proceedings.
