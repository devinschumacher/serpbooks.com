*A Women's History*

<br>

At every turn in the development of what we now know as the western, women writers have been instrumental in its formation. Yet the myth that the western is male-authored persists. This groundbreaking work debunks that myth by recovering the women writers of popular westerns who were active during the genre's formative years. Through detailed studies of authors like Emma Ghent Curtis, Muriel Newhall, B. M. Bower, Katharine Newlin Burt, and Frances McElrath, Victoria Lamont shows how these writers placed female characters at the center of their western adventures and used genre conventions in innovative ways. Original archival research reveals the significant role of women in shaping the western, from cowboys and schoolmarms to gun violence and cattle branding, while their feminist critiques of patriarchy run throughout these pioneering works.
