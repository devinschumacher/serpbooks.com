*Life in Baseball's Negro Leagues*

This organized professional league became a platform for African American and Hispanic players to showcase their remarkable talents, drawing large crowds in cities across the country.

The league's success spanned the 1920s and beyond, featuring legendary players like Smokey Joe Williams, Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, Buck Leonard, and Oscar Charleston. Led by colorful figures such as Gus Greenlee and Effa Manley, the league represents a crucial chapter in African American history that has long been overlooked. This book shares the memories of surviving players to honor the "invisible men" who brought their extraordinary skills and dedication to the segregated baseball leagues of the early 20th century.
