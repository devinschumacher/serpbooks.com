<br>

When Morality and Architecture was first published in 1977, it sparked intense debate within the architectural community, with some praising it as a groundbreaking polemic and others lambasting it as an unfairly critical attack on modernist architecture. The book traced the development of architectural thinking back to influential figures like Pugin and Viollet-le-Duc, challenging the notion that modernist style was the only truthful and rational approach to building design. In this revised edition, author David Watkin reflects on the book's impact and argues that many of the criticisms he raised still resonate today, making it a significant work for understanding architecture's evolution.

*A Practical Guide to Clear Communication about the Built Environment*

<br>

Architecture stands as the most comprehensive and complex of all art forms, shaping our daily lives through its brilliant designs and engineering marvels.

Through rigorous analysis of historical, cultural, political, and psychological influences, Younes provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how architects evaluate and justify building forms in an increasingly complex professional landscape.

*Architecture and Its Discontents*

<br>

In the mid-20th century, architectural critique emerged as a powerful force, shaping what we now recognize as modern architecture. However, the 1960s brought a Marxist-inflected reevaluation that questioned whether architecture could truly be critical, given its inherent ties to power and commerce. This collection of essays, penned by an international roster of architects and theorists, explores how recent economic upheavals and the growing influence of research methods have sparked a resurgence of architectural critique, particularly from postcolonial and feminist perspectives.

<br>

Architecture begins to matter when it brings delight and sadness, perplexity and awe along with a roof over our heads. In this classic work, Paul Goldberger shows us how that works in examples ranging from a small Cape Cod cottage to the vast, flowing Prairie houses of Frank Lloyd Wright, from the Lincoln Memorial to the Guggenheim Bilbao. He argues that the emotional impact of great architecture remains vital, even as the field shifts its focus to social justice and sustainability.
