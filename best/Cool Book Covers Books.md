*The Untold Story of Libraries for African Americans in the South*

<br>

During the height of the Civil Rights Movement, over eighty "Freedom Libraries" sprang up across the Deep South, offering African Americans their first taste of library freedom amidst a sea of segregation. Staffed by civil rights workers and operating in the shadows of sanctioned racism, these grassroots libraries became bold hubs of resistance, sparking change that would forever alter the face of American librarianship and society. Through intimate photographs and carefully curated stories, this collection highlights the incredible courage of both librarians and patrons who risked everything for the simple right to read.
