*On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are*

<br>

In this profound work, Alan Watts presents a revolutionary understanding of human identity that challenges our deepest assumptions about who we are and our place in the universe. Drawing from the ancient Hindu philosophy of Vedanta, he reveals how the self is not a separate entity but the very root and ground of existence itself. This realization, Watts argues, holds the key to resolving the fundamental conflicts that arise from our mistaken belief in isolation and separation. The Book serves as both a philosophical primer and a practical guide for anyone seeking to align with the truth of their own being, offering timeless wisdom for navigating the complexities of life in the modern world.
