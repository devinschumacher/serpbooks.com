He's given her five years to grieve her late husband, all the while gathering the courage to confess his feelings to her. Bit by bit, the magic of the holidays draws them closer, and she begins to return his affection. But will falling in love with his boss lead to delight or heartache? Let Your Heart Be Light is a heartwarming story about second chances and the unexpected paths love takes us down.
