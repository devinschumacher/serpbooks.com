*Religion in a Pluralistic World*

<br>

In this pioneering work, anthropologist Felicitas Goodman offers a "unified field theory" of religion by examining the universal human behaviors that give rise to spiritual experiences. Drawing from cross-cultural evidence of ritual practices dating back to prehistoric times, the book demonstrates how religious consciousness emerges from specific brain states that allow contact with alternate realities. The second part of the work systematically compares worldwide religious systems, showing how they adapt to different societal types from hunter-gatherers to city dwellers. This important study presents a comprehensive framework for understanding religion as a fundamental aspect of human consciousness that has evolved alongside our species.
