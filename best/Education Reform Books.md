*Breaking the gridlock in education reform*

<br>

In the mid-1990s, the Alfred Glickman School was a struggling institution in one of America's most violent cities. After SABIS, a private education provider, took over, the school transformed from a failing entity to a six-time silver medalist in U. S. News & World Report's "America's Best High Schools" listing, with every graduate accepted into college. This remarkable turnaround raises critical questions about the role of for-profit companies in public education reform. Despite the clear benefits demonstrated, why does the idea of private sector involvement face such intense opposition? "Last Bell" delves into these complexities, examining the motivations behind the resistance to market-based solutions in education and imagining a future where competitive forces improve public school performance across the board.
