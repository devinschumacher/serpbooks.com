<br>

In thiscompact 123-page manifesto, Brazilian jiu-jitsu pioneer Brian Jones articulates the fundamental differences between traditional self-defense jiujitsu and modern sport jiujitsu. Drawing from the art's Japanese roots and the experiences of early Brazilian practitioners, Jones presents old school jiujitsu as a distinct style that prioritizes street effectiveness over competition rules. The book serves as both a tribute to those who have maintained the original principles of the art and a call to action for instructors and practitioners to preserve the legacy of traditional jiujitsu in the face of growing sportification.
