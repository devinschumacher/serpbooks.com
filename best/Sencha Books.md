*The Art of Sencha*

<br>

While the Japanese tea ceremony typically brings to mind the Zen-influenced chanoyu and its distinctive matcha whisking technique, this illustrated study explores the lesser-known sencha tradition. Unlike chanoyu, sencha features steeped green leaf tea prepared in an atmosphere reflecting Chinese literati values and elite culture. The book traces sencha's evolution from its seventeenth-century introduction by Chinese merchants and scholar-monks to its nineteenth-century peak, examining how this simple leaf tea became a symbol of intellectual refinement and cultural resistance against the dominant chanoyu tradition.
