Through careful examination of testing's historical development, author Gerard Giordano reveals how this educational tool has mirrored and influenced major societal shifts, making it an indispensable lens for understanding 20th-century American education.

*Choice-Based Assessments for the Digital Age*

<br>

In the digital age, education must prepare students to make informed choices rather than merely retrieve facts. This groundbreaking book argues that choice-based assessments, which evaluate how well students can decide what to learn, how to learn it, and when to apply their knowledge, are more effective than traditional tests of factual recall. Drawing from cognitive science and leveraging interactive digital technologies, Daniel Schwartz and Dylan Arena demonstrate how these innovative assessments can measure the true outcomes of education: independent thinking and effective decision-making. Their approach not only reshapes how we evaluate learning but also addresses crucial questions of assessment fairness and practical implementation.
