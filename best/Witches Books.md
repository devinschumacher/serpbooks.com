<br>

In this groundbreaking work, Margaret Alice Murray traces the worship of the Horned God from paleolithic times to the medieval period, revealing witchcraft as the survival of an ancient religion rather than an isolated phenomenon of the Middle Ages. Through meticulous examination of witchcraft's rites and ceremonies, she introduces the concept of the "dying god"--the priest-king whose ritual death ensured fertility and strength for his people. This classic study demonstrates how figures like Thomas a Becket, Joan of Arc, and Gilles de Rais fit into the broader context of pagan spiritual leadership, challenging readers to reconsider their understanding of Europe's religious history.

*Critical Essays on 21st Century Television Portrayals*

<br>

After Charmed ended in 2006, witches mostly appeared as sidekicks to vampires or in children's programs. However, during the mid-2010s, they began to resurface as leading characters in shows like The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, the Charmed reboot, Salem, American Horror Story: Coven, and A Discovery of Witches. This collection examines how TV witches transformed from sweet, feminine, domestic, and white to powerful, diverse, and transgressive representations of third-wave feminism. Notable scholars analyze the reemergence and shifting identities of these witches through intersectional gender studies, hauntology, politics, morality, monstrosity, violence, queerness, disabilities, rape, ecofeminism, linguistics, family, and digital humanities, situating their evolution in the aftermath of the #MeToo movement.

*The Legacy of the Witch Hunts and Why Women Are Still on Trial*

<br>

In this meticulously researched work, French feminist Mona Chollet defends the witch as a symbol of female rebellion and independence, exploring the historical persecution of three specific groups of women: widows, childless women, and the elderly. Through scholarly examination and cultural analysis, Chollet draws striking parallels between the infamous witch hunts of the past and the ongoing struggle for women's rights, arguing that the figure of the witch represents society's eternal attempt to suppress female autonomy and control over their own bodies.
