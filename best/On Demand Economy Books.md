*How Power Operates in the Flexible Workplace*

This groundbreaking work integrates modern control theory with political economy to analyze the complex interplay between income distribution, effective demand, and capitalist accumulation.

By deriving spectral approximations of inter-industry relationships and evaluating both mainstream and radical value theories, the book offers valuable insights into demand multipliers and accumulation fluctuations that are crucial for understanding economic cycles and policy implications.
