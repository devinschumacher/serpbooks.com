<br>

This meticulously researched book reveals the vital role of medieval friars in English healthcare, from their arrival in the 1220s to their dispersal in the 1530s. Drawing on previously unexplored manuscript evidence, Peter Murray Jones demonstrates how four orders of friars became integral to medical practice, serving everyone from royalty to the poor through their unique blend of spiritual and physical healing. The book highlights key figures like William Holme and the influential Tabula medicine, showing how friars developed distinct medical writings that continued to influence healthcare long after the Reformation.
