In this USA TODAY bestseller, Kelli Estes weaves a powerful historical novel inspired by true events. When Inara Erickson discovers an elaborately embroidered silk sleeve hidden in her aunt's island estate, she unearths a tragic story from 1886 Seattle, where young Mei Lien was the sole survivor of a devastating Chinese purge. As Inara deciphers the embroidered tale, her life becomes intricately linked with Mei Lien's, forcing her to choose between exposing family secrets and honoring the memory of a brave Chinese-American girl who refused to let her story die. Through careful embroidery, Mei Lien shared her darkest experiences, creating an elegant thread that binds their stories across generations. The Girl Who Wrote in Silk explores how delicate silks can hold centuries of secrets and how our actions today shape tomorrow's stories.
