In "Land of the Fee, " political scientist Devin Fergus exposes how hidden transaction fees have become a significant driver of American wealth inequality.

Fergus traces the historical roots of this fee system and its impact on middle-class Americans, revealing how these often waived charges for the affluent represent a substantial financial burden for the rest of the population. The book demonstrates how this previously overlooked aspect of financial policy has contributed to the widening economic divide in the United States.
