## [Pair Programming and Unobtrusive Monitoring](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Pair+Programming+and+Unobtrusive+Monitoring?i=stripbooks)

*Toward an Automated Partner Matching System*

<br>

Pair programming is a common practice in introductory programming courses, but students without existing connections often struggle to find appropriate partners. This dissertation investigates the effectiveness of self-selected partnerships and explores how machine learning can be used to support students who have difficulty finding suitable programming partners. Through longitudinal surveys and maze-solving experiments, the research examines student perceptions, assignment difficulty, and programming success rates, demonstrating the potential for automated partner matching systems to improve educational outcomes.
