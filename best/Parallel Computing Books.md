<br>

Elements of Parallel Computing introduces advanced undergraduate and graduate students to the core concepts of parallel computing, focusing on algorithmic structures and programming models rather than hardware details. The book covers SIMD, shared memory, and distributed memory machine models, decomposition techniques, and performance analysis methods including work-depth analysis and communication analysis. Through three case studies on the Single Source Shortest Path Problem, the Eikonal equation, and 2D convex hull computation, the text demonstrates practical applications of parallel programming principles while contrasting different algorithmic approaches to the same problems.
