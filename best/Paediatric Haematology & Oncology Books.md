<br>

The Girl from the Hermitage follows Galina, a young Soviet girl caught in the devastating siege of Leningrad, as she navigates a world of horrors alongside her friend Vera. In a twisted irony, Galina mourns the passing of this dark era, where even the Hermitage's cellarsoffer only temporary solace. Nearly forty years later, as a respected teacher in a transformed St. Petersburg, Galina faces anew set of challenges that threaten to upend her carefully constructed life. Through intimate glimpses into Galina's journey, this debut novel weaves together themes of survival, creativity, and the unyielding human spirit against the backdrop of a changing Russia.
