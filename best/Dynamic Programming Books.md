This book introduces innovative optimal control methods and game schemes based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) techniques. For single-input systems, it develops ADP-based optimal control strategies for various objectives, while for multi-player systems, it proposes optimal control inputs through game theory. The authors analyze the convergence and stability properties of ADP methods and support their findings with practical application examples.

## [Dynamic Programming Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Dynamic+Programming+MultiObjective+Combinatorial+Optimization?i=stripbooks)

![Dynamic Programming Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/nYYbEAAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

This book presents a comprehensive approach to solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems through dynamic programming. It introduces a novel model using circuits without repetitions to represent feasible solutions, along with increasing and strictly increasing cost functions. The authors develop algorithms for multi-stage and bi-criteria optimization, as well as methods for counting solutions within this framework. The effectiveness of these techniques is demonstrated across eleven classic problems, including matrix chain multiplication, global sequence alignment, and optimal bitonic tours. This work serves as both a valuable resource for researchers in combinatorial optimization and a practical guide for developing exact optimization algorithms.

*3rd Edition*

<br>

This third edition of a seminal work synthesizes decades of research on dynamic programming (DP) foundations with modern approximate DP theory and novel semicontractive models. The book presents a unified theory of total cost sequential decision problems through the lens of fixed point theory, emphasizing the crucial roles of monotonicity and contraction in DP mappings. It explores the implications of these properties for approximate DP algorithms and introduces semicontractive models, illustrated by stochastic shortest path problems. The new edition expands coverage to include abstract DP models for sequential minimax problems and zero-sum games, complementing the author's influential works on neuro-dynamic programming, optimal control, and reinforcement learning.
