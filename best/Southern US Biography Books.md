*Race and the Reconstruction of Southern Identity, 1865-1915*

<br>

In the wake of the Civil War, the North imposed its vision of a reconstructed South, sparking fierce resistance from southern whites who fought against these changes on both legal and cultural fronts. Through careful examination of southern storytelling from 1865 to 1915, K. Stephen Prince reveals how white southerners rewrote their regional narrative, romanticizing the Lost Cause and birthing the New South myth. This cultural battle, Prince argues, was crucial in redirecting the nation away from Reconstruction's egalitarian promises and toward the entrenched racism of Jim Crow.
