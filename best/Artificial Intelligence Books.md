Drawing distinctions between AI's "reckoning" capabilities and the ethical, deliberative nature of human thought, Smith explores the implications of AI's rapid development and offers guidance on how to harness its power while preserving our commitment to responsible action and ethical consideration.

*Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control*

<br>

As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly sophisticated, the risk of conflict between humans and machines grows. Distinguished AI researcher Stuart Russell presents a bold solution: redesign AI systems to be inherently uncertain about human preferences, making them humble, altruistic, and provably beneficial. This foundational shift could enable us to coexist safely with intelligent machines, unlocking their potential while ensuring they remain deferential to human needs and values.

*Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust*

<br>

In "Rebooting AI, " professors Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis offer a clear-eyed assessment of artificial intelligence's current state and its future potential. Drawing from their extensive experience at the forefront of AI research, these authors explain why recent milestones like computer programs beating humans at Jeopardy! represent only narrow achievements in closed systems. They argue that genuine AI requires common sense and deep understanding rather than just statistical analysis and data collection. The book explores how to bridge the gap between artificial and human intelligence, suggesting that a wiser approach to AI development could lead to trustworthy machines that enhance our daily lives without the risk of creating uncontrollable "superintelligences.
