*On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are*

<br>

In this profound work, Alan Watts presents a revolutionary understanding of human identity that challenges our deepest assumptions about who we are and our place in the universe.

This realization, Watts argues, holds the key to resolving the fundamental conflicts that arise from our mistaken belief in isolation and separation. The Book serves as both a philosophical primer and a practical guide for anyone seeking to align with the truth of their own being, offering timeless wisdom for navigating the complexities of life in the modern world.

In this groundbreaking work, political philosopher Allan Bloom examines the intellectual foundations of America's contemporary social and political challenges.

Bloom's insightful analysis reveals how this intellectual contraction, led by the university elite, has shaped a cultural climate that resists critical thinking and fosters conformity. The twenty-fifth anniversary edition features a new afterword by Andrew Ferguson, contextualizing Bloom's enduring influence and the ongoing relevance of his warnings about American intellectual life.

*Themes and Variations in Kants Moral and Religious Philosophy*

<br>

Adrian Moore challenges the notion that ethical thinking can be grounded in pure reason, examining three central themes of Kant's philosophy: morality, freedom, and religion. Through detailed analysis of Kantian concepts including the categorical imperative and free will, Moore defends a view of reason that acknowledges its social and cultural conditioning. The book weaves together traditional analytic philosophy with contemporary ideas about 'thick' ethical concepts and forms of life, ultimately arguing that the highest rational act is to make sense of our experiences and values.

*Lessons Learned in the Obama White House About the Future of Faith in America*

<br>

Through raw and intimate glimpses into faith within the highest echelons of government, Michael Wear offers unparalleled insights into the triumphs and trials of Christian service in public office. "Reclaiming Hope" stands as an insider's chronicle of the Obama administration's most polarizing moments, from the president's evolving stance on gay marriage and the politicization of religious freedom, to the administration's inability to bridge divides on abortion and the contentious selection of an inauguration benediction. Beyond its historical account, the book delivers a powerful plea for robust faith engagement in the public square, challenging Christians to view politics as a sacred calling for neighborly love and justice. This work stands as a thoughtful and often provocative examination of how faith intersects with the complexities of governance.

*Speaking Truth in a Distracted Age*

<br>

In this groundbreaking work, Alan Noble tackles the twin challenges of a distracted and secular age, offering both analysis and hope for Christians seeking to live faithfully in the 21st century. Drawing from Charles Taylor's influential "secular age" thesis, Noble describes how modern life has become saturated with distractions that prevent deep engagement with faith and reality. The gospel, he argues, must disrupt these patterns through embodied practices that point to transcendent truth and beauty, rather than succumbing to abstraction and cliché. This book serves as a practical guide for individuals, churches, and cultures to cultivate disruptive witness in a world that desperately needs it.

In this award-winning exploration, Alan Noble examines how the Christian gospel offers a radically different understanding of identity and belonging. Contrasting the modern assumption that "you are your own" with the Heidelberg Catechism's declaration that "I am not my own, but belong with body and soul, both in life and in death, to my faithful Savior Jesus Christ, " Noble shows how this biblical perspective provides freedom from the anxiety and isolation that plague contemporary life. Through insightful analysis and compelling argument, "You Are Not Your Own" invites readers to embrace a vision of humanity that restores meaning and purpose to our existence.
