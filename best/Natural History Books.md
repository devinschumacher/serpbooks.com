This biography introduces readers to William Stimpson, a pioneering American naturalist who worked alongside the legendary Louis Agassiz and Spencer F. Baird in the 19th century. After serving as the naturalist for the United States North Pacific Exploring Expedition, Stimpson helped establish the Smithsonian Institution's department of invertebrate zoology and worked to make the Chicago Academy of Sciences a national leader in scientific research and education. Tragically, both his career and scientific legacy were cut short by the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 and his subsequent death from tuberculosis, making this book a poignant window into a transformative era in American natural history.
