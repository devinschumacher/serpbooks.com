In the sweltering summer of 1991, Michael and Francis navigate the complexities of growing up as young men of color in Toronto's Park housing complex. While their Trinidadian mother works tirelessly to provide for them, the brothers find fleeting moments of freedom and imagination amidst the daily challenges of racism and low expectations. Their hopes and dreams are tested against the backdrop of a tragic shooting that exposes the fragile nature of their community and the dark undercurrents of police violence that threaten to consume everything they hold dear.
