<br>

Blue jeans have evolved from the rugged workwear of 19th-century miners to become a global symbol of casual elegance, their indigo hue now as likely to grace a fashion runway as a pair of hands stained by labor. This Object Lessons book explores the paradoxes of denim: how a fabric designed for durability has become synonymous with style, and why the color once associated with freedom carries the weight of industrial exploitation in its history.
