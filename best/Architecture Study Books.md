*A Study of the Arts in America, 1865-1895*

<br>

Between 1865 and 1895, America witnessed a remarkable flourishing of the arts, often referred to as the Brown Decades. This period saw the emergence of artists like Root, Sullivan, Roebling, Homer, Eakins, and Ryder, who would later become pillars of American art. Despite its significance, this artistic renaissance remained largely unrecognized until Lewis Mumford's groundbreaking study brought these pioneering works to light through twelve carefully selected illustrations.

*A Study of Collaboration*

<br>

In 1897, Frank Lloyd Wright joined forces with Robert Spencer, Dwight Perkins, and Myron Hunt in a shared Chicago office space that would become the incubator of an architectural revolution. This meticulously researched book examines the short but impactful period when these young architects collaborated on designs and theories that would influence the field for decades to come. Through detailed comparisons of their work and analysis of their subsequent careers, author Stuart Cohen presents compelling evidence of a creative "collaborative circle" that challenges the traditional notion of the lone architectural genius. The story unfolds against the backdrop of Steinway Hall, the office building Perkins designed that became the vibrant center of Chicago's architectural community at the turn of the century. Cohen's work not only reinterprets Wright's early years in Chicago but also offers a fresh perspective on the development of modern architecture through the lens of these four pioneering collaborators.
