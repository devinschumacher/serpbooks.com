*Educational Equity and High-Impact Practice*

<br>

This groundbreaking book demonstrates how to integrate authentic research experiences into the first two years of undergraduate education, addressing a critical gap in current practice where such opportunities are often limited to juniors and seniors. By embedding research projects within general education courses, author Nancy H. Hensel provides a practical framework that makes high-impact research experiences accessible to a broader student population, including those who must work during academic terms and summers. The book outlines key considerations for designing age-appropriate research activities, offers strategies for mentoring entire classes of student researchers, and highlights the role of citizen-science projects in early undergraduate research education. Drawing from examples across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, this resource equips faculty at four-year and two-year colleges with adaptable methods to enhance their teaching practices and prepare students for future research careers.
