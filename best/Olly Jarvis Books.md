## [The Problematics of Moral and Legal Theory](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/The+Problematics+of+Moral+and+Legal+Theory?i=stripbooks)

<br>

In this provocative work, Richard Posner challenges the legal profession's infatuation with moral and constitutional theory, arguing that this theoretical obsession has led lawyers and judges to ignore the practical realities that shape American law. Drawing from a century of legal thought, Posner calls for a return to the pragmatic approach championed by Oliver Wendell Holmes, emphasizing the importance of empirical evidence and policy analysis in resolving legal disputes. Through a detailed examination of the field's most influential thinkers and their impact on constitutional law, this book offers both a critical assessment of legal theory's limitations and a hopeful vision for a more fact-based legal system.
