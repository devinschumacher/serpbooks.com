When Damien Harrington is accused of murdering his birth father, Josh Roland, it kicks off a legal battle that will change everything Harper Ross thought she knew about her law partner. As she fights to clear his name, she uncovers dark secrets about Roland's criminal past that make this case far more complicated than any they've faced before. With her teenage daughters causing chaos at home and her own romantic life in turmoil, Harper must keep it together long enough to see justice done in this gripping ninth installment of the Kansas City Legal Thrillers series.
