*Christian Humanism and the Moral Imagination*

<br>

In "Confronting a Controlling God, " Catherine M. Wallace argues for a fundamental shift in Christian thinking, tracing the roots of religious authoritarianism back to competing translations of Moses's encounter with the burning bush. She calls for a "Copernican turn" that places compassion and loving-kindness at the heart of Christian faith, challenging the notion that human control is divinely sanctioned. This short, powerful work demonstrates how redefining God as compassionate Presence can transform not only religious practice but the very fabric of Western culture.

*Doctrine and Life as Fuel and Fire*

<br>

Martyn Lloyd-Jones, one of the twentieth century's most influential preachers, believed that Christian doctrine and life should burn together like fuel and fire. Originally trained as a medical doctor, he transformed souls through his deep understanding of how gospel truths shape everyday faith and practice. In this carefully selected collection of his teachings, pastor Jason Meyer highlights Lloyd-Jones's greatest sermons on the Christian life, showing why separating doctrine from life leads to spiritual anaemia. Through Meyer's insightful summaries, readers will discover how to feed their own spiritual hunger with the same passion that drove Lloyd-Jones to know God more intimately.

*The Promise of an Almost Forgotten Tradition*

<br>

Christian Socialism emerged in mid-19th century England as a powerful alternative to the prevailing philosophy of political economy, now known as neoliberalism. This carefully constructed tradition within Anglican political thought rejects both institutional change and nationalisation, instead advocating for a fundamental reform of society's moral foundations. Philip Turner's insightful exposition reveals how this once-influential movement continues to shape our understanding of what it means to be human, offering profound implications for the future of Christianity and society alike.
