## [Estimating the systematic component of credit spreads](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Estimating+the+systematic+component+of+credit+spreads?i=stripbooks)

![Estimating the systematic component of credit spreads | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/q0mGEAAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

Corporate bond credit spreads often exceed historical default rates, creating a gap known as the "credit spread puzzle. " This thesis reviews research methods for decomposing credit spreads, then empirically examines systematic risk in EUR-denominated credit spreads from 2009 to 2021. The study compares these findings to US bond market data, analyzing how different cross-sections and market regimes affect credit spreads and debt beta calculations.
