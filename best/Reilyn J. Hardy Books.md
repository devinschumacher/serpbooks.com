*The Pitfalls and Promise of Popular Control*

In this insightful work, Craig Borowiak examines democratic accountability as a complex concept that goes beyond traditional electoral models. By analyzing accountability through the lens of multiple democratic traditions, he reveals the tensions between popular control and political authority in an era of global turbulence. The book argues that true democratic accountability requires embracing destabilization and public participation rather than seeking to legitimize existing power structures. Borowiak's analysis offers both scholars and practitioners a more nuanced understanding of how democratic accountability can be realized in world politics.
