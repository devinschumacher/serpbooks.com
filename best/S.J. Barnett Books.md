*The Myths of Modernity*

In this carefully researched study, S. J. Barnett challenges the conventional wisdom about religious change in 18th-century Europe, revealing how much of our understanding has been based on limited evidence and assumption.

*The myths of modernity*

<br>

This scholarly work challenges prevailing notions about religious change in eighteenth-century Europe by examining the intellectual and social dynamics that shaped the era. Focusing on Italy, France, and England, S. J. Barnett reveals how traditional Enlightenment studies have overstated the influence of Deism, demonstrating that the historical evidence does not support the notion of a widespread Deist movement. The book argues that the ideological appeal of the "birth-of-modernity" myth has led historians to overlook the limited impact of enlightened thought on contemporary religious practice, offering a more nuanced understanding of the period's spiritual and intellectual evolution.

*The Origins of Enlightenment Anticlericalism*

<br>

This philosophical work examines how religious dissent evolved into Enlightenment anticlericalism through the polemical writings of English and Italian thinkers from the Reformation to the late 17th century. By comparing the historical and sociological critiques developed within both Protestant and Catholic traditions, the author demonstrates how these intellectual currents converged to shape high Enlightenment thought. The book highlights the crucial transition that occurred around 1700, when earlier church criticisms gave way to a more comprehensive 'Deist' perspective on Church history.
