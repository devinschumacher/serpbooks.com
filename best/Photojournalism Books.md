*"Hansel Mieth? Reform Photojournalism, 1934-1955 "*

<br>

This photographic study traces the remarkable journey of German immigrant Hansel Mieth from farm worker to Life magazine photographer, highlighting her groundbreaking work as a working-class reformer in the 1930s and 1940s. Through intimate photo essays on birth control, labor unions, and Japanese American internment, Mieth's camera captured controversial truths that challenged the conservative narrative of her time. The book draws from Mieth's unpublished memoir and oral histories to present a nuanced portrait of a photographer whose commitment to social reform continues to influence photographic storytelling today.
