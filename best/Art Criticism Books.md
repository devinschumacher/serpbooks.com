What is the true role of an art critic? In this insightful examination, philosopher Noel Carroll argues that the critic's primary responsibility is not merely to describe or interpret artworks, but to evaluate their cultural and artistic merit.

Through thoughtful analysis and compelling examples, this influential book restores evaluation to its rightful place in the critical process, arguing that genuine criticism enhances our understanding of art's impact on human experience.
