*National Education Standards and the Threat to Democracy*

<br>

The Common Core State Standards Initiative has transformed K-12 education through standardized curricula in math and English language arts, while similar frameworks have been implemented for science and sexuality education. This policy shift towards national education standards has sparked intense debate, with proponents arguing for higher academic benchmarks and critics warning of centralized government control over educational content and methods. Nicholas Tampio examines the historical, philosophical, and practical implications of these standards, ultimately questioning whether the benefits justify the democratic costs of such a sweeping educational reform.
