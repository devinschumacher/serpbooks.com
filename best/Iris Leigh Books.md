*The Swimmer as Hero*

<br>

In this masterful work of cultural history, Charles Sprawson explores how different cultures have interpreted water and swimming throughout history.

Through the stories of legendary swimmers like Byron, Brooke, and Weissmuller, and informed by literature and film, this work dives into the psychological and cultural depths of what it means to be submerged in water.
