*Enhancing Sleep, Supervision, and Safety*

<br>

Medical residents often face grueling work schedules, but in 2003, graduate medical education implemented strict new requirements to protect both patients and doctors from the dangers of excessive fatigue.

Based on extensive evidence linking sleep deprivation to medical errors, the authors recommend radical changes to residency training, from mandatory nap periods during long shifts to complete overhauls of the work environment that prioritize safety and education over mere hours logged.

In 1849, Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman in America to receive an M. D. , paving the way for her younger sister Emily to join her in this groundbreaking achievement. Together, they founded the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children, the first hospital staffed entirely by women. Janice P. Nimura's meticulously researched biography traces the sisters' remarkable journey from Bristol to the rising cities of antebellum America, where their visionary approach to medicine challenged the notion that "a hundred years hence, women will not be what they are now.

*Is a University the New Doctor*

<br>

In "Education Mania: Is a University the New Doctor? ", Joshua Flapan examines the disconnect between college degrees and their real-world value. He argues that the true benefits of higher education often go unrecognized, as evidenced by the number of college graduates facing unemployment or underemployment. Through five chapters of insightful analysis, Flapan explores why traditional academic credentials fail to deliver on their promises and offers practical solutions to bridge the gap between education and employment. The book serves as a bold critique of the modern university system and a call for innovative approaches to workforce development.
