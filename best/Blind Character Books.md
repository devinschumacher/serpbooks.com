*Death, Disability and Cure in Classic Fiction for Girls*

<br>

In this insightful critique, Lois Keith examines how classic children's novels have historically treated death and disability, highlighting the Victorian notion that physical suffering serves as punishment for moral transgressions. Through careful analysis of works ranging from "Heidi" and "The Secret Garden" to modern classics like "Deenie, " Keith exposes the persistent belief that disabled lives are inherently incomplete and that sufficient willpower can overcome any illness. Her study not only illuminates the problematic messages these beloved books impart to young readers but also celebrates the profound impact they continue to wield over devoted audiences.
