<br>

In this profound and often hilarious novel, Jenny Offill explores how a dedicated librarian named Lizzie navigates the emotional chaos of our turbulent times. Through her work answering letters for a popular podcast about preparing for the worst, Lizzie grapples with the growing darkness in both her personal life and the world around her. As her carefully constructed responses begin to mirror her own mounting despair, she must confront the uncomfortable truth that sometimes the most challenging part of our job is looking after ourselves.
