<br>

In this meticulously researched volume, Vera Kaplan examines the pivotal role of historians and historical societies in shaping the public life of imperial Russia from 1895 to 1918. Centering on the Society of Zealots of Russian Historical Education, the study illuminates the intricate web of voluntary associations that flourished during this period, demonstrating how these organizations bridged the gap between academic scholarship and public education. Unlike their contemporaries, the Zealots embraced a conservative worldview while advocating for a modernist educational agenda, creating a unique space for both professional and amateur historians to contribute to the cultural and intellectual landscape of late imperial Russia. Through its analysis of the Society's activities, including their influential periodicals and support for free public libraries, the book challenges conventional notions of civil society in the Russian Empire, revealing a vibrant cultural sector that operated with remarkable independence from state control.

In this masterful account, Orlando Figes traces Russia's thousand-year history through the lenses of its national mythologies and imperial ideologies. From the candlelit crowning of Ivan the Terrible to Putin's war against Ukraine, The Story of Russia reveals the enduring ideas that have shaped the country's past and continue to influence its turbulent present. Figes examines the medieval myth of Mother Russia's holy mission, the imperial legacy of autocratic rule, and the cult of sacrifice that formed the notion of the "Russian soul. " As Russians have repeatedly revised their own history to align with shifting ideologies, their storytelling has become both a vital aspect of their national identity and a source of tension with the West. This scholarly work illuminates how Russia's complex historical narrative informs its current role on the global stage.
