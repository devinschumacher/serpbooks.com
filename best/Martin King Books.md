When Robert F. Kennedy authorized the FBI to wiretap Martin Luther King Jr. 's phones, he unleashed one of the most invasive surveillance operations in American history.

Based on the agency's own surveillance records, historian David Garrow illustrates the extraordinary lengths to which the FBI went to monitor King's every move, exposing the depths of J. Edgar Hoover's personal vendetta against the civil rights leader.
