![An Abstraction for Version Control Systems | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/\_4-Qdmlf1xIC?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

Version Control Systems (VCS) allow developers to track changes to software artifacts, with multiple client programs accessing these systems. Currently, no standard abstraction connects different VCSs, resulting in custom solutions for each client implementation. This thesis presents Pur, an abstract framework for version control that enables rich client programs to support multiple VCSs. The authors have implemented this abstraction and tested it by developing a client application, proving Pur's value in providing consistent version control interaction.

## [Towards version control in object-based systems](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Towards+version+control+in+objectbased+systems?i=stripbooks)

![Towards version control in object-based systems | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/wclmDwAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

Version control plays a crucial role in software development by managing code changes. While traditional systems focus on tracking files, some environments like Smalltalk operate exclusively with objects. This report introduces a framework that integrates object versioning with existing control systems, demonstrating its capabilities through a prototype that tracks Squeak/Smalltalk objects using Git. The framework represents each object as a collection of slots, providing a generic approach to versioning diverse object types.
