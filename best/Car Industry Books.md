*How the American Automobile Industry Destroyed Its Capacity to Compete*

<br>

At its peak in the 1950s and 1960s, automobile manufacturing was the largest and most profitable industry in the United States, generating substantial income for residents of industrial hubs like Detroit and Flint, Michigan. However, a series of misguided production process changes aimed at reducing union power ultimately led to decreased efficiency and innovation, making it difficult for American automakers to compete with foreign manufacturers who adopted more flexible production systems. This sociological analysis examines the unintended consequences of weakening labor unions and offers insights into how new business models prioritizing innovation could help revive the struggling U. S. auto industry.
