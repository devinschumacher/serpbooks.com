*The Death of William Posters, A Tree on Fire, and The Flame of Life*

<br>

In this compelling trilogy, British novelist Alan Sillitoe continues his exploration of working-class rebellion through the character of Frank Dawley. The first novel follows Dawley as he leaves his factory job and marriage behind, embarking on a journey across England, Spain, and Morocco that leads him to join an Algerian independence movement. The second book finds Dawley returning to England, where he forms a commune with painter Albert Handley and Myra Bassingfield in Buckinghamshire. However, their ideals are tested when a young Spanish anarchist arrives, threatening to expose a dark secret from Dawley's past. Through these interconnected stories, Sillitoe masterfully examines the tensions between individual freedom and social responsibility, offering a powerful commentary on British working-class rebellion in the 1960s.
