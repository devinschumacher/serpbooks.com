*Uke Becomes Tori*

<br>

During the late 19th century, as Western nations increased their engagement with the Far East, a group of Japanese martial arts instructors introduced jujutsu and judo to Europe and the United States. This anthology examines how these ancient combat systems adapted to Western culture, encountering both acceptance and transformation. Six technical chapters by David Finch, along with contributions from the Journal of Asian Martial Arts, analyze the key figures who established judo and jujutsu in the West. The collection covers the founding of The Budokwai in London and the development of its distinctive Kime-no-kata. By highlighting the influence of European and American martial traditions on Japanese arts, the anthology reveals the reciprocal nature of cultural exchange between East and West.
