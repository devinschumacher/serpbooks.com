*The Biography of Douglas Haig*

<br>

Posterity has not been kind to Douglas Haig, the commander of the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front for much of the First World War. Frequently portrayed as a commander who sent his troops to slaughter in vast numbers at the Somme in 1916 and at Passchendaele the following year, Haig's record in these battles has been thoroughly re-examined in this definitive biography. More importantly, it presents a fresh evaluation of Haig himself, exploring the nature of the man through both his early life and army career before 1914, as well as his dedicated work for ex-servicemen's organizations after 1918. This meticulously researched biography separates the man from the myth, offering readers a nuanced understanding of one of history's most controversial military leaders.

*How to Get Beyond the Statistics Wars*

<br>

In "Statistical Inference as Severe Testing, " Deborah Mayo presents a philosophical framework for evaluating statistical methods that goes beyond traditional approaches focused on error rates and degrees of belief. The book examines the replication crisis in social and biological sciences through the lens of severe testing, a concept that emphasizes the importance of rigorous scrutiny in scientific inference. Mayo argues that many proposed reforms to statistical practice fail to meet the standards of severe testing and are incompatible with effective strategies for addressing cherry picking and selective reporting. Drawing from the philosophy and history of induction, the book illustrates how to apply severe testing principles to distinguish between science and pseudoscience, offering practical guidance for statistical consumers and researchers navigating the complex landscape of modern inference.

*Selfish Genes, Social Selves, and the Meanings of Life*
