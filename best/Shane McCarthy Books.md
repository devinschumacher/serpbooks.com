*Truman, Secret Warfare and the CIA, 1945-53*

<br>

Based on recently declassified documents, this book examines the Truman Administration's decision to employ covert operations against the Soviet Union from 1945 to 1953. It reveals why these operations were adopted, why they failed, and why the administration continued to pursue them despite their lack of success. The author argues that the Truman Administration's inability to reconcile policy, strategy, and operations led to the waste of valuable resources on covert actions that had little chance of challenging Soviet hegemony.
