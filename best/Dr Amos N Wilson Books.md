## [Black-on-Black Violence](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/BlackonBlack+Violence?i=stripbooks)

*The Psychodynamics of Black Self-annihilation in Service of White Domination*

<br>

In this groundbreaking work, Amos N. Wilson presents a bold thesis: Black-on-Black violence in the United States is not merely a social phenomenon, but a carefully engineered process that maintains the psychological and economic dependency of African-American and Pan-African communities. Published in 1990, this book moves beyond conventional blame to expose the intricate psycho-social dynamics at play, revealing how the criminalization of Black males serves the broader agenda of white domination. Despite this grim analysis, Wilson offers a glimmer of hope, arguing that while the origins of this violence lie in systematic oppression, its resolution rests in the hands of black people everywhere.

In 1712, a British slave owner named Willie Lynch arrived in Virginia with ideas that would transform American slavery from brute force to psychological warfare. Through a speech delivered to American slaveholders on the banks of the James River, Lynch revealed methods that broke spirits rather than bodies, sowing seeds of distrust that would pit slave against slave. This historical manuscript illuminates the roots of systemic racism and the enduring impact of Willie Lynch's legacy on contemporary society.
