## [Learning from the Test](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Learning+from+the+Test?i=stripbooks)

*Raising Selective College Enrollment by Providing Information*

<br>

In the last decade, five U. S. states mandated college entrance exams for high school juniors, with striking results. In the two earliest-adopting states, nearly half of students took the test, and 40-45% earned scores eligible for selective colleges. Following implementation, selective college enrollment rose by 20% without affecting overall attendance rates. This print-on-demand report presents compelling evidence that many high-ability students dramatically underestimate their college readiness, highlighting the significant impact of informed policy interventions on human capital investment.
