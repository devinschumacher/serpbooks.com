When Humpty Dumpty sits on a hawker stall eating kaya toast, and Jack and Jill grill satay on a hill, you know it's a book where nursery rhymes meet Singapore's vibrant food scene. This clever collection reimagines classic children's poetry with a local twist, featuring familiar hawker dishes in unexpected scenarios. The three blind mice, for instance, enjoy chicken rice at the hawker centre, while other rhymes highlight the beloved street food that defines Singapore's culinary landscape. Janice Khoo and Lianne Ong have created a playful read-along that maintains the rhythm and charm of traditional nursery rhymes while introducing young readers to the diverse world of Singapore hawker food.
