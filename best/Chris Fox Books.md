*Branding Conservatism as Working Class*

<br>

"Fox Populism" by Reece Peck explores the network's ascension to dominance through its pioneering blend of conservative ideology and tabloid-style reporting. Peck's analysis of Fox News' coverage during the late-2000s financial crisis illustrates how the channel has cultivated a counter-elite identity that deeply connects with its viewership. By simplifying complex economic issues for "the real Americans," Fox News has profoundly influenced both political discourse and cultural attitudes. The study underscores the powerful impact of television style and imagery in shaping public perception.
