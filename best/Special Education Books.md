*The Institutional Shape of Special Education*

<br>

This book traces the evolution of special education in the United States, examining how compulsory attendance laws passed in the 1840s created three distinct categories of school-age youth: the common, delinquent, and special. It explores how these laws formalized "rules of access" to public education, leading to the gradual inclusion of students with physical and mental disabilities alongside juvenile delinquents. The author shows how this shift has expanded the special education field over the past thirty years, reshaping public education through the development of new handicapping categories and professional standards.
