<br>

In this groundbreaking study, Edna Bonacich and Richard Appelbaum uncover the dark underbelly of Los Angeles' thriving apparel industry, where sweatshops have made a disturbing comeback.

The authors highlight the industry's paradoxical growth in Los Angeles, driven by a demand for trendy women's wear and fueled by an influx of low-wage immigrant workers. Behind the Label shines a spotlight on the dire need for government regulation and union intervention to address the shocking inequality that plagues the sector, offering hope through the emerging antisweatshop movement.

When award-winning author Kiersten Modglin's marriage hits rock bottom, she proposes an unconventional solution to save it: one night a week, they'll each date someone new, keeping their experiences strictly between themselves. What starts as a desperate attempt to reignite their faltering marriage evolves into something far more complex, testing the very limits of trust and forcing them to question everything they thought they knew about love and loyalty. This ingeniously plotted domestic thriller will keep readers guessing until the very end, where the Greensburgs' carefully constructed world changes in ways no one expected.

Tao Lin's witty autobiographical novella traces his unconventional path through American culture.

Through intimate observations of class and culture, the story offers a fresh perspective on coming of age in the digital era, where every experience is colored by the understanding that time moves irreversibly forward.
