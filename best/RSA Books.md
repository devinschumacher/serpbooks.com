This undergraduate research paper presents an improved RSA algorithm that enhances both the strength of encryption and the speed of computation. By integrating Proth numbers and Mersenne prime numbers, the author develops a cryptographic system superior to the original RSA algorithm. The paper details the strengthened encryption form, outlines the proposed architecture, and evaluates the performance improvements through comparison with the conventional RSA method.
