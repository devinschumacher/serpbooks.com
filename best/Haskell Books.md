*His Life and Civil War Papers*

<br>

All Civil War enthusiasts owe a debt to Frank Haskell for his masterful description of the Battle of Gettysburg, penned as a lieutenant on John Gibbon's staff. This collection presents Haskell's thirty-one wartime letters, showcasing his remarkable talent for capturing the chaos and heroism of combat. From his discouragement following the defeat at Chancellorsville to his fatal wound at Cold Harbor, these letters offer an intimate window into the mind of a young officer grappling with the horrors of war. Published posthumously, Haskell's account of Pickett's Charge stands as one of the most compelling firsthand descriptions of Civil War combat, forever cementing his place in American military history.

*Forging Commonwealth Bonds in Renaissance Virginia*

<br>

In "For God, King, and People, " Alexander Haskell reveals how the first English planters in Virginia viewed their endeavors as divinely inspired commonwealth creation rather than mere colonization. Drawing from a forgotten English Renaissance mindset that intertwined sovereignty and Providence, Haskell demonstrates how these early settlers and their London sponsors saw Virginia as the fulfillment of a humanist ideal. When faced with the complexities of American governance, these ideals evolved dramatically, marking the beginning of secular conceptions of state power and offering a radical revision of early modern state formation as an outcome of colonial endeavor rather than its antecedent.

*My Unlikely Path as a 22-Year-Old Lawmaker*

<br>

At just twenty-two years old, Will Haskell decided to tackle the political establishment head-on, running against a longtime incumbent in his hometown state Senate race. With no professional experience and an unconventional campaign team consisting of his roommate and girlfriend's mom, Haskell turned his bold vision for Connecticut's future into a historic victory that caught even President Obama's attention. This inspiring story shows that no one is too young to make their mark on history, as Haskell traded his college graduation for an unexpected journey into public service that would forever change his community.
