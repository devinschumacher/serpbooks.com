*Sound Transitâ€™s Fight to Save Light Rail*

<br>

"Back on Track" chronicles Sound Transit's remarkable journey from near-collapse to becoming the backbone of Puget Sound transportation. After decades of battling congestion without rail, Seattle voters approved a $3.9 billion plan in 1996 to bring mass transit to the region. But when the project faced a billion-dollar overrun and years of delays, the fledgling agency came under furious public critique. As administrators resigned and lawsuits mounted, new director Joni Earl fought to preserve the agency's vision. With a crucial federal grant and bold leadership, she turned Sound Transit from "unsound" to a daily reality serving nearly 50 million passengers a year. This Washington State University Press publication shows how, against all odds, a team of dedicated professionals transformed Seattle's transportation landscape.
