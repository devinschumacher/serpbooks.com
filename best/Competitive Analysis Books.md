<br>

This thesis presents a novel approach to automating the analysis of natural language sections in financial reports through the development of a Competitive Analysis Ontology (CAO). The CAO enables the extraction of relevant information by modeling the business analyst's information requirement as a series of Semantic Paths, grounded in domain-specific linguistic and user heuristics. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through the Analyst Work Bench (AWB), a tool that processes Form 10-Q disclosures and populates the CAO, showing a 37% improvement in information identification compared to manual analysis.
