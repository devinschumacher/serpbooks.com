*The Campaign Against Established Knowledge and Why It Matters*

<br>

In the 1990s, a group of "AIDS denialists" led by a UC professor challenged the medical establishment's consensus that HIV causes AIDS. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, this small group's incorrect beliefs threatened to undermine public health efforts. The subsequent discovery of HIV and development of preventive measures ultimately proved the denialists wrong, but their campaign highlights the ongoing struggle between established knowledge and those who reject scientific consensus.
