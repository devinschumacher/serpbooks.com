The Reign of James VI explores the Scottish monarch's rule through the lenses of court literature, noble factionalism, and legal reforms. This scholarly work challenges traditional interpretations of James as a Melvillian king or a figurehead of "laissez faire monarchy, " instead presenting him as an active ruler who expanded the royal court and state apparatus. The book covers his literary pursuits, diplomatic efforts, and complex relationships with religious institutions, while also examining his legacy in the Scottish Highlands and Borders regions.
