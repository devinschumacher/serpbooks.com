The study presents two detailed templates for IT professionals navigating cloud adoption, incorporating considerations for risk tolerance and security requirements. Drawing from standards set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), and European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), these templates offer step-by-step guidance on constructing cloud security architectures and implementing governance frameworks in the cloud environment.
