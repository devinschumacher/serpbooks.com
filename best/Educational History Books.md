*A Social History of Pittsburgh’s First Public High School*

<br>

The Schenley Experiment chronicles the remarkable journey of Pittsburgh's first public high school, established in 1855 as Central High School and later reorganized as Schenley High School in 1916. This innovative educational institution served as a social incubator in a highly segregated city, achieving improbable success through its commitment to diversity and academic excellence. The school's history spans groundbreaking achievements, from integrating decades before Brown v. Board of Education to fostering a renowned academic program that attracted teachers like future Pulitzer Prize winner Willa Cather. However, Schenley's story also reflects the broader challenges of urban public education, facing periods of destructive neglect and default segregation during the 1970s before experiencing a powerful resurgence in the late 1980s under Superintendent Richard C. Wallace. The school's closure in 2008, despite being a North Oakland neighborhood cornerstone, marks a controversial chapter in Pittsburgh's educational history. Through meticulous research and hundreds of first-person accounts, Schenley alumnus Jake Oresick presents this compelling narrative of a school that stood as a bold experiment in public education, leaving an indelible legacy on Pittsburgh and American schooling practices.

This historical analysis demonstrates how today's educational marketplace emerged from the interplay of public authority and private sector innovation.
