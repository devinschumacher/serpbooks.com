In 1843, the New Zealand Company settlement of Nelson was rocked by a pivotal revolt of its emigrant labourers. Over 70 gang-men and their wives collectively resisted their poor working conditions through petitions, strikes, and ultimately, violence. This microhistory uncovers the previously obscured story of these labourers, examining who they were, where they came from, and how their experiences of protest before arriving in Nelson influenced their struggle. By centering on violence and class conflict, Jared Davidson's work challenges familiar narratives of colonial New Zealand, highlighting the ongoing relevance of these early conflicts to our understanding of the nation's social and political foundations.
