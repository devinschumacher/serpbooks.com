*A Memoir*

<br>

Discrete Mechanics: Concepts and Applications presents a comprehensive framework for understanding mechanical systems through a discrete lens. Building on Galileo's foundational ideas and the principles of relativity and equivalence, this text develops the equation of motion using acceleration as an absolute quantity in a local reference frame. It explores how this discrete approach applies to various physical phenomena, from fluid dynamics to elastic solids, demonstrating the versatility of discrete mechanics in modeling complex systems while maintaining mathematical rigor.
