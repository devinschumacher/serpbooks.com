*Lessons Learned from Thrive Project for America Training*

<br>

What does it take to win in lacrosse and in the game of life? This guide reveals the lessons learned by high school lacrosse players who underwent a rigorous training program led by Navy SEALs. The four-hour session combined intense physical challenges with classroom instruction, teaching the young athletes how mindset influences performance. Through pushups, sit-ups, a 1.5-mile run, and team relays, the players learned to push beyond their limits while connecting the physical activities to real-world life lessons. The book captures their experiences, from hitting self-imposed walls to achieving breakthroughs, and shows how developing mental toughness can lead to success both on and off the field.
