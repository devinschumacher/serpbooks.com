*Archaeology and the Public in Nineteenth- Century America*

In nineteenth-century America, the landscape of the Midwest yielded fascinating remnants of indigenous cultures, sparking a complex relationship between public and archaeology. As farmers unearthed arrowheads and built houses atop burial mounds, scholars grappled with explaining these artifacts, leading to competitive discoveries and traveling exhibitions that would reshape American cultural identity. Through meticulous research in over a dozen archives, this social science exploration reveals how encounters with ancient artifacts, culminating in the iconic "Kentucky Mummy" find, influenced everything from rural museums to the Smithsonian Institution, leaving an enduring legacy on our understanding of the American past.
