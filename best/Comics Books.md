*Reframing History in Comics*

<br>

Through five meticulously selected graphic novels and memoirs, this pioneering study reframes the civil rights movement from marginalized perspectives. Jorge Santos examines how these works, ranging from Ho Che Anderson's complex King biography to the intimate immigrant experience in Darkroom, utilize the graphic medium to challenge conventional historical narratives. The anthology highlights the ongoing process of collective memory making and invites readers to consider how history is (re)told, (re)produced, and (re)narrativized through visual storytelling.
