*Canadians and Anti-Americanism*

<br>

In this extensively revised second edition of his influential work, J. L. Granatstein traces the complex evolution of Canadian anti-Americanism from the United Empire Loyalists to the post-war nationalist movement. He argues that while the sentiment began as a legitimate fear of American invasion, it transformed into a powerful tool wielded by economic and political elites to maintain their grip on power. Initially a preserve of Tory sentiment, anti-Americanism later became the principal weapon of the nationalist left in their battle against free trade. Through careful analysis of key historical moments and figures, Granatstein demonstrates how this once-pervasive attitude has weakened dramatically in recent decades, leaving readers to ponder its future role in Canadian politics and culture.

<br>

In this incisive study, historian J. L. Granatstein argues that Canadian history is being systematically erased from public consciousness through misguided educational policies and multicultural initiatives. Drawing from startling statistics on young Canadians' historical illiteracy and his own expertise, Granatstein demonstrates how the social studies approach to teaching history has failed to instill basic knowledge of our nation's past. The book, timed to coincide with the Vimy Ridge centenary, serves as both a damning indictment of current historical education practices and a call to action to preserve Canada's rich cultural heritage before it's too late.
