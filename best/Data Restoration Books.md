*A Data Recovery Approach, Second Edition*

<br>

In this thoroughly updated second edition, Boris Mirkin presents a groundbreaking data recovery approach to clustering that bridges the gap between theory and practice. The book systematically explores both partitioning (K-Means) and hierarchical clustering methods, providing rigorous mathematical foundations for these widely used techniques. Through 374 pages, this CRC Press publication demonstrates how clustering can be transformed from an art into a science, offering readers a deeper understanding of the mathematical principles that govern cluster analysis.

## [Instant Recovery with Write-Ahead Logging: Page Repair, System Restart, Media Restore, and System Failover, Second Edition](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Instant+Recovery+with+WriteAhead+Logging+Page+Repair+System+Restart+Media+Restore+and+System+Failover+Second+Edition?i=stripbooks)

<br>

Database recovery has traditionally focused on three failure classes: transaction failures, system failures, and media failures. This second edition expands on those concepts by introducing single-page recovery, which enables efficient incremental "redo" and "undo" operations during system restarts and media restores. The authors, Goetz Graefe, Wey Guy, and Caetano Sauer, detail how these techniques can provide the illusion of instant recovery, allowing database servers to resume operations seconds after a reboot or on empty replacement media. The book also covers self-repairing indexes and faster offline restore operations that complete backups instantly without server load.
