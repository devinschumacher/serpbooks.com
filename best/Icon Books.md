In the summer of 1999, Russia stands on the brink of chaos. As a powerless interim president watches helplessly from Moscow, the country descends into famine, inflation, and criminality. Amid this turmoil, a former army sergeant named Igor Komarov rises to lead the right-wing UPF party, his promises of law and prosperity resonating with the desperate masses. But beneath his golden tongue lies a dark secret exposed in the Black Manifesto, a document that threatens to upend the fragile balance of power. When an iconic figure from the CIA's past is drawn back to Moscow, he faces not only the mission to stop Komarov but a personal vendetta against the KGB's most ruthless officer, now serving at the party's highest levels. As the January 2000 presidential election looms, an ex-agent-runner returns to a city that threatens to consume everything he holds dear. In this masterful thriller, Frederick Forsyth weaves a tale of political intrigue and high-stakes espionage that reads like tomorrow's headlines.

<br>

Darwin's theory of evolution faced a major challenge for over a century: the "transitional fossils" that should have documented the connections between key organism groups were notably absent from the historical record. This scientific gap fueled intense debates among paleontologists, with some suggesting that these "missing links" had existed and disappeared too quickly to leave any trace. However, a series of groundbreaking fossil discoveries in recent decades has dramatically transformed this field of study. From walking whales in Pakistan to feathered dinosaurs in China, these findings have not only filled crucial gaps in our understanding of evolution but also raised intriguing questions about our own place in the natural world. "Written in Stone" chronicles this fascinating hunt for evolution's missing pieces, showcasing how paleontology has been revolutionized by these remarkable discoveries.

*Travels with my Elders*

When Ben Aitken discovers that his gran's coach holiday includes four nights of three-course dinners, sixteen pints of lager, and luxury return travel for just a hundred pounds, he trades his millennial lifestyle for six coach trips across Europe. Joining a group of eccentric British pensioners, Ben races against time to soak up their wisdom, candour, and hard-earned ability to live each day like it's nearly their last. From Scarborough to St Ives, Killarney to Lake Como, this moving and hilarious journey reveals the gap between thirty-something blues and the golden years of storytelling that await on the other side.
