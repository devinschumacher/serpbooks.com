Materials in Trial Advocacy, Tenth Edition, immerses students in the work of a trial lawyer through full cases and accompanying files that present real-world evidentiary and tactical challenges.

The new edition features a civil case between an oil and gas producer and landowner, a semester-long pretrial and trial advocacy exercise, and a historic labor dispute case.
