*A Manifesto*

In this updated edition of her Sunday Times Bestseller, classicist Mary Beard brings her academic expertise to bear on the gender agenda, examining how history has treated powerful women from Medusa to Hillary Clinton. Through 87 insightful pages, this feminist manifesto exposes the cultural underpinnings of misogyny while offering beacon-like examples of how women resist being packaged into a male template of power. From ancient Rome to the #metoo movement, Beard's work stands as a timely call for change in how we understand and represent women's power.

*A Kaleidoscope, 1847-1870*

<br>

In this meticulously researched work, acclaimed historian Mary Beth Norton examines the pivotal year of 1774 that transformed loyal British subjects into American revolutionaries. Through extensive primary sources, she reconstructs the political debates that occurred between the Boston Tea Party and the Battles of Lexington and Concord, revealing how local committees and provincial congresses gained power at the expense of British authority. Norton demonstrates how colonists effectively declared independence in early 1775 by following the decrees of their elected governments rather than British officials, setting the stage for the formal Declaration of Independence the following year.
