<br>

The aircraft landing gear stands as a masterful blend of system, structure, and machine engineering, tasked with supporting the aircraft on the ground while minimizing weight and drag during flight. This comprehensive work guides readers through the intricate design process, covering everything from airfield compatibility and tire selection to shock absorber design and retraction mechanisms. The book delves into the complexities of landing gear architecture, examining the interplay between gear design and airframe structure, and explores the latest developments in hydraulic and electric servo systems. As the heaviest non-structural component of an aircraft, the landing gear demands meticulous attention to detail and regulatory compliance, making this volume an essential resource for engineers and students alike in the quest for safer, more efficient aircraft landings.
