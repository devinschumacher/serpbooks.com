*Papers of the 37th Annual Spring Symposium of Byzantine Studies, In Honour of Professor A.A.M. Bryer*

<br>

This scholarly anthology examines every aspect of food and wine in Byzantium, from monastic protocols to palace dining etiquette. Through 308 meticulously researched pages, editors Kallirroe Linardou and Leslie Brubaker compile evidence of agricultural innovation, culinary preservation techniques, and the cultural significance of eating together in Byzantine society. The volume honors Professor A. A. M. Bryer's foundational work on Byzantine agricultural implements and offers insights into how the Byzantines viewed their diet, including the rhetorical uses of food as a metaphor for redemption and the social implications of eating as a vice or abstinence as a virtue.
