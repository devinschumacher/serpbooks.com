*A Study in Perpetual Motion*

<br>

In this scholarly yet accessible study, John Leshy examines the 1872 Mining Law and its profound impact on Western development and federal resource policy. Originally designed to promote mineral extraction in the era of pick-and-shovel prospecting, this legal framework has survived largely unchanged despite significant shifts in mining technology and land use priorities. Leshy explores how executive and judicial interpretations have attempted to address the law's limitations, while highlighting the growing tension between mineral development and environmental stewardship. Through careful analysis of the law's origins and operation, this work provides essential context for understanding the complex interplay between legal precedent and societal change in the management of America's mineral resources.
