*How the Middle Class Secures Advantages in School*

<br>

In this insightful ethnographic study, Jessica McCrory Calarco reveals how middle-class students develop a distinct advantage in school through strategic negotiations with teachers and administrators.

The study highlights the limitations of programs that attempt to teach middle-class behaviors to working-class students, instead advocating for approaches that recognize and value the unique strengths of all students.
