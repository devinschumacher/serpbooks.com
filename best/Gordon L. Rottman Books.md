*Marines battle for Vietnam’s vital hilltop base*

<br>

In the remote hills of northwest South Vietnam, a small Marine battalion faced off against determined North Vietnamese Army forces in a battle that would last from October 1967 to July 1968. Setting up their base in the village of Khe Sanh, a critical crossroads of enemy supply routes, the Marines found themselves in the middle of escalating combat operations.
