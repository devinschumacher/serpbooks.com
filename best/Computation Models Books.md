*A Laboratory of Images in the Eighth and Ninth Centuries*

<br>

In "Emerging Iconographies of Medieval Rome, " Annie Montgomery Labatt examines the development of Christian iconography in Rome during the eighth and ninth centuries, focusing on four distinct forms: the Anastasis, Transfiguration, Maria Regina, and Sickness of Hezekiah. Through formal analysis and reference to patristic writings, this study challenges traditional scholarship that has marginalized Rome's artistic significance, instead presenting the city as a dynamic center of creativity that shaped medieval Christian imagery before the East-West schism.
