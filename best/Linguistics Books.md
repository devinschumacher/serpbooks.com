![The Linguistics of Punctuation | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/r4SuQgAACAAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

In "The Linguistics of Punctuation, " Geoffrey Nunberg presents a groundbreaking analysis of how written language employs punctuation marks and figural devices as category indicators. Challenging the conventional wisdom that written language merely mirrors spoken language, Nunberg reveals a distinct "text-grammar" system that coexists with lexical grammar and governs the structure of English text-sentences through a set of systematic syntactic and presentational rules. These rules, largely acquired through tacit knowledge rather than formal instruction, demonstrate how natural language principles are applied to the unique domain of written communication.

![The Linguistics Wars | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/KXU8DwAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

From the mid-twentieth century onward, linguistics has evolved into a vibrant and occasionally divisive academic discipline. This book examines the major theoretical split that occurred during the 1960s and 1970s, catalyzed by Noam Chomsky's seminal work "Aspects of the Theory of Syntax." It demonstrates how Chomsky's most devoted disciples interpreted his foundational concepts in fundamentally different ways, resulting in a decade of rigorous theoretical debates that would permanently reshape the field of linguistics. Through carefully selected anecdotes and thorough historical analysis, "The Linguistics Wars" provides an intimate look at the development of scientific theory and the lasting impact of generative semantics on contemporary linguistic studies.

*The Eastern Traditions of Linguistics*

<br>

This comprehensive history of linguistics marks the first volume in a five-part series exploring the scientific study of language across Eastern traditions. Authored by Giulio C. Lepschy and published by Routledge, the book examines Chinese linguistics, Indian grammatical tradition, Near Eastern linguistic interests, Hebrew tradition, and Arabic grammatical systems of the Middle Ages. Drawing from original syntheses of primary sources, this volume provides an authoritative perspective on language's social, cultural, and religious functions, its role in education, and the historical prestige of various language varieties. The work carefully avoids forcing ancient concepts into modern linguistic frameworks, offering instead a respectful examination of these diverse linguistic traditions within their own historical contexts.
