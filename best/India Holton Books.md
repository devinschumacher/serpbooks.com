*The Hidden History of the American Revolution*

<br>

In this meticulously researched account, prizewinning historian Woody Holton revisits the American Revolution through the previously untold perspectives of its marginalized participants: enslaved Africans and African Americans, Native Americans, women, and religious dissenters. Drawing from over a thousand eyewitness records, "Liberty Is Sweet" reveals how these groups, often in conflict with the Founding Fathers, shaped the course of history from the battles of Lexington and Concord to the British surrender at Yorktown. Holton's narrative highlights the crucial yet overlooked factors that influenced the war's outcome, including disease, weather, and public opinion, offering readers a deeply nuanced understanding of the events that led to the creation of the Constitution and the birth of a nation.
