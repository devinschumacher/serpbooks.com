*A Reflexive Law Approach*

<br>

This concise work examines the regulatory challenges of cryptocurrencies, arguing that current approaches fail to address the unique technical and governance features of these digital assets. Through a "reflexive law" framework, author Immaculate Dadiso Motsi-Omoijiade identifies internal self-regulatory mechanisms within cryptocurrency systems and proposes strategies for regulators to engage with these mechanisms effectively. Drawing from legal, technical, and historical perspectives, the book illustrates why successful cryptocurrency regulation requires consideration of both "Fin" and "tech" dimensions. It will be of particular interest to researchers, academics, and policymakers in financial regulation and jurisprudence.
