*Mathematics as Storytelling*

<br>

In "The Meaning of Proofs, " mathematician Gabriele Lolli presents a compelling argument that mathematical proofs are fundamentally narrative in nature. Drawing parallels between literature and mathematics, Lolli demonstrates that every proof tells a story of intellectual adventure and discovery. The book explores how mathematical reasoning, far from being merely formulaic, relies on creative narrative techniques to uncover and explain abstract concepts. Through this philosophical and poetic reflection, Lolli invites readers to appreciate mathematics as a dynamic field of inquiry deeply connected to the human experience of storytelling.
