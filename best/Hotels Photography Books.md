<br>

In 1981, Sophie Calle took an unconventional job as a chambermaid at the Hotel C in Venice, Italy. Using her mop bucket as a disguise for her camera and tape recorder, she turned her cleaning duties into an artistic investigation of the guests' personal lives. Assigned to 12 rooms on the fourth floor, Calle documented every detail of their stay through photographs and recordings, from the books they read to the clothes they wore. Her work, originally published in French by Actes Sud in 1998 and later in English by Violette Editions, blends forensic precision with conceptual artistry, offering an intimate window into the private moments of strangers. This book represents the culmination of her three-year project at the hotel, where she simultaneously cleaned and created, leaving behind a unique body of work that has been exhibited worldwide.

<br>

"A Room for the Night" presents artist Alex Yudzon's visual explorations of hotels as transitional spaces through site-specific installations. By repurposing hotel room furniture, Yudzon creates unexpected, gravity-defying arrangements that transform mundane interiors into contemplative environments. The book documents his experiences in various American hotels, where each installation temporarily reimagines familiar spaces through subtle interventions.
