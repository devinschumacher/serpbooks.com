*The Popular Philosophy of Narrative*

<br>

In this stimulating literary theory exploration, David Wittenberg argues that time travel fiction serves as a narrative "laboratory" where theoretical questions about storytelling intersect with scientific advancements. Drawing from physics, philosophy, and film theory, Wittenberg demonstrates how popular time travel narratives evolved from sociopolitical commentary to sophisticated explorations of temporal structure and subjectivity. Through close readings of works by H. G. Wells, Robert Heinlein, and others, this 444-page volume reveals the deep philosophical underpinnings of the genre, showing how mainstream audiences engage with complex questions about temporality, identity, and history that resonate across literary criticism and scientific theory.

In this groundbreaking novel, four female scientists in 1967 invent a time travel machine that threatens to upend everything they know about the past and future. As one of them spirals into madness, her breakdown puts the entire project at risk. Sixty years later, in a world where time travel has become a commercial reality, a young woman receives a cryptic message from the future about an impending murder. Racing against time, she uncovers a dark secret that connects her to the very scientists who started it all, in a story that New York Times called "breathtakingly tender and wryly understated. "

*Probability and Impossibility*

<br>

Time travel: a concept that challenges our understanding of reality and possibility. In this philosophical exploration, Nikk Effingham examines the most compelling arguments against time travel, from objects existing in two places at once to the infamous Grandfather Paradox. He contends that these arguments fail to prove time travel impossible, instead revealing gaps in our knowledge of probability and decision theory. The book concludes with a cautionary look at the risks of time travel, highlighting why we must be vigilant in preventing any form of temporal displacement, no matter how small or unlikely.

*Episodic Memory and Our Knowledge of the Personal Past*

<br>

Memory research has become increasingly interdisciplinary, and this book presents a philosophical account of remembering that draws on current psychological theories of episodic memory. Kourken Michaelian argues that remembering is a form of mental time travel, developing a simulation theory of memory that emphasizes the constructive nature of recall. The book explores the reliability of simulational memory processes and offers an evolutionary framework that distinguishes human episodic memory from animal memory systems.
