![Sustainable Architecture – Between Measurement and Meaning | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/xgj9DwAAQBAJ?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

"Sustainable Architecture - Between Measurement and Meaning" by Carmela Cucuzzella and Sherif Goubran explores the critical balance between technical standards and human-centered design in achieving sustainable built environments. The book argues that while new technologies and materials offer exciting possibilities for reducing environmental impact, architecture must not lose sight of its fundamental role in creating meaningful spaces for human activity. Through theoretical reflections and practical applications, the authors demonstrate how sustainable architecture can maintain its expressiveness and cultural relevance in an increasingly data-driven field. The 176-page publication serves as a valuable resource for architecture students, researchers, and practitioners seeking to understand the human dimension of sustainable design.
