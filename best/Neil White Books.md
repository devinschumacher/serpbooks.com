*Organized Resistance to the Second Reconstruction, 1954-64*

In this meticulously researched account, Neil R. McMillen charts the rise and fall of the Citizens' Councils of America, a Southern organization that spearheaded massive resistance to school desegregation following the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision.

McMillen approaches his subject with historical sensitivity, recognizing the complex motivations behind the councils' actions while firmly positioning himself on the side of civil rights progress. This updated edition includes a new preface and bibliography, solidifying its place as a masterful study of a tumultuous chapter in American civil rights history.

*Mexicans, Blacks, and Poor Whites in Texas Cotton Culture*

<br>

In this groundbreaking work, Neil Foley examines the intricate web of racial and ethnic relations in Texas cotton culture from the Civil War to the 1940s. Bridging the gap between African American and Southern history on one hand and Chicano and Southwestern history on the other, this study reveals how Mexican sharecroppers and farm workers complicated the traditional black-white dichotomy of rural labor relations. As corporate agribusiness transformed the landscape, white racial identity began to fracture along class lines, giving rise to a "fringe of whiteness" where Mexican, African American, and poor white identities intersected. Through meticulous archival research and oral history interviews, Foley redefines whiteness not as a monolithic status but as a complex matrix of power and privilege that continues to shape American race relations.

*From Cheap Diversity to True Solidarity*
