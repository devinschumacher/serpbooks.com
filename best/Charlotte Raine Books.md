## [Anglican Ritualism in Victorian Britain, 1830-1910](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Anglican+Ritualism+in+Victorian+Britain+18301910?i=stripbooks)

![Anglican Ritualism in Victorian Britain, 1830-1910 | Image](https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/55aaZGqqh6oC?fife=w4000-h6000&source=gbs\_api)

<br>

This scholarly work examines the impact of ritualism on the Victorian Anglican church, challenging the notion that its influence was limited to working-class and urban areas. Through careful analysis of ritualist practices in middle-class and rural parishes, the author demonstrates the widespread adoption of elaborate worship customs, including the use of altars, clergy stalls, and surpliced choirs. The book also explores the ecclesiastical and legal debates surrounding these changes, providing context for the Public Worship Regulation Act of 1874 and ritualism's lasting impact on Anglican worship.
