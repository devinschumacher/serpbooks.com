*The Emergence of Ornithology as a Scientific Discipline, 1760-1850*

<br>

"Discovering Birds" explores how ornithology developed as a scientific discipline between 1760 and 1850. Paul Lawrence Farber examines this period as a case study in natural history's evolution, showing how it transitioned from an 18th-century focus to become part of the broader biological sciences in the 19th century. This work demonstrates that the natural history of the 1700s did not disappear with the advent of modern biology, but rather transformed into a more systematic study of birds as living organisms.

*American Ornithology after Audubon*

<br>

In the decades following the Civil War, as America underwent rapid industrialization and urbanization, a new passion emerged among the middle and upper classes: birds. This surge in ornithological enthusiasm led hundreds of thousands to join Audubon societies, purchase field guides, and venture into nature to record their sightings. As Mark Barrow Jr. recounts in this meticulously researched history, professional ornithologists struggled to establish their discipline amidst this tidal wave of popular interest, founding the American Ornithologists' Union in 1883 and expanding educational opportunities. Yet, even as ornithology achieved professional status by the mid-20th century, its practitioners remained dependent on amateur enthusiasts for crucial field data. Barrow masterfully weaves together the efforts of scientists, conservationists, and dedicated birdwatchers against the backdrop of America's environmental challenges, providing both historians and modern bird enthusiasts with a captivating look at the roots of American ornithology.
