In a world where comics were once considered mere children's entertainment, Roger Sabin traces the remarkable evolution of adult comics from underground "comix" to cultural phenomenon. This comprehensive survey spans over a century of comics for mature readers, from the pioneering works of the late 1800s to the graphic novel boom of the 1980s and 1990s. Along the way, it explores the vibrant underground scene of the 1960s and 1970s, the rise of manga-inspired "gekiga" in Japan, and the enduring appeal of samurai stories among older readers. Sabin's work challenges the conventional wisdom that comics only "grew up" in the 1980s, revealing a rich history of innovation and artistic expression that continues to influence our cultural landscape today.
