*Greed, Mismanagement & Political Manipulation at America's Largest Charitable Trust*

<br>

When Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop died in 1884, she left her vast Hawaiian lands and riches to five trustees, envisioning a legacy that would nurture and educate future generations of Hawaiians through Kamehameha Schools. By the 1990s, however, this noble trust had grown to control an astonishing one-ninth of all Hawaiian land, making it the largest private landowner in the state's history. The fall from grace began in 1997 when four respected kupuna and a trust law professor exposed the dark underbelly of Bishop Estate's operations, revealing a decades-long saga of incompetence, abuse, and high-level corruption that threatened to destroy the very institution Pauahi Bishop had created.
