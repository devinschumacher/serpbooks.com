*Nationhood in Cherokee Writing, 1907–1970*

<br>

Historian Kirby Brown examines the literary works of several twentieth-century Cherokee writers who, following Oklahoma statehood, preserved and reimagined their nation's legacy through various literary forms. Faced with the dissolution of the Cherokee government and subsequent assimilation policies, these writers turned to tribal histories, novels, plays, and public addresses as alternative venues for resistance and cultural maintenance. The collection features critical analyses of works by historian Rachel Caroline Eaton, novelist John Milton Oskison, educator Ruth Muskrat Bronson, and playwright Rollie Lynn Riggs, demonstrating how their writings countered the prevailing "dark age" narrative of this period in Cherokee history. Through detailed examinations of these diverse texts, "Stoking the Fire" illustrates the writers' efforts to maintain Cherokee cultural identity and their contributions to American Indian and Indigenous studies, highlighting the enduring nature of Cherokee nationhood.
