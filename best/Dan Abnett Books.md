In this strategic masterpiece, Colonel-Commissar Gaunt returns to the heart of the crusade after a dangerous mission, only to find his Ghosts facing an existential threat on the forge world of Urdesh. As Imperial forces attempt to divide and conquer their enemy, Warmaster Macaroth commands the besieged Urdesh campaign against Anarch Sek's brutal armies. But what begins as a battle for planetary control evolves into something far more personal - an audacious attempt by the Archenemy to decapitate the Imperial command structure with a single, deadly strike. With the Warmaster himself potentially an unwitting target, Gaunt must marshal his resources and determination to defend not just a planet, but the very leadership of the crusade against the overwhelming forces of Chaos threatening to consume everything in their path.
