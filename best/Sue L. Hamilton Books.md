In this powerful conclusion to the Ivory Carver Trilogy, two Aleut women from different tribes forge an extraordinary alliance against the cruelty of their shared fate. As an accomplished ivory carver, Kiin leads a fulfilling life with her twin sons and devoted husband until she's brutally torn back to her former existence as a slave to the Raven, her husband's malevolent brother. Across the frozen landscape, Kukutux, the widowed wife of a Whale Hunter, fights to survive in a clan that rejects her. Their desperate struggles for freedom and dignity set the stage for a heart-wrenching confrontation that tests the limits of human endurance and the strength of their spirits against the ruthless backdrop of their ancestral home.
