*A Gentle Introduction*

<br>

This graduate-level text explores the interplay between logic and computational complexity, presenting Pavel Pudlák's insights on these foundational areas of mathematics. The 699-page volume covers essential concepts in mathematical logic and set theory, while also delving into computational complexity and proof complexity. Through a gradual progression from fundamental ideas to more complex theories, the book demonstrates why complexity is as crucial to mathematical foundations as computability and provability.

*Fundamentals of Theoretical Computer Science*

<br>

This comprehensive text introduces theoretical computer science through five parts covering 17 chapters. It begins with mathematical proofs and computability theory using an abstract programming language, then explores regular and context-free languages, essential logic for computer science, and computational complexity theory, including NP-completeness. The final part delves into advanced recursion and polynomial-time computability theories, featuring priority constructions for recursively enumerable Turing degrees. This foundational work serves as an essential resource for mathematics students and anyone interested in the mathematical underpinnings of computer science.
