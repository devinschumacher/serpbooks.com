In "The Politics of Regulatory Change, " Richard Harris and Sidney Milkis examine the evolution of American regulatory politics over three critical decades. Through a comparative study of the Federal Trade Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency, the authors assess the lasting impact of Reagan-era deregulatory efforts and the resilience of the "public lobby regime" that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s. The second edition of this influential work extends their analysis through the Bush and Clinton administrations, revealing how successive attempts to reduce social and economic regulation have polarized Washington beyond mere policy differences to fundamental disagreements about the purpose of American government.

Regulation in the States offers an in-depth examination of economic regulation across all 50 states, analyzing 10 key sectors including telecommunications and professional licensing.

The study reveals that while state-level regulation is neither perfect nor universally effective, policy decisions typically reflect careful consideration of ideology and evidence rather thanindustry influence. Teske concludes with a thoughtful evaluation of potential reforms, highlighting important exceptions such as occupational regulation where state-level oversight plays a particularly crucial role.
