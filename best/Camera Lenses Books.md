## [Byron, Hunt, and the Politics of Literary Engagement](https://serp.ly/@serpbooks/github/amazon/Byron+Hunt+and+the+Politics+of+Literary+Engagement?i=stripbooks)

<br>

In the second decade of the nineteenth century, the British press launched a campaign of critical abuse against Leigh Hunt, portraying the radical journalist as an upstart "Cockney" author whose literary talents were as disreputable as his politics. Lord Byron, on the other hand, was revered as a peer and a poetical genius who, the conservative press argued, would never associate with a writer like Hunt. Yet Byron did just that, forming a close friendship and literary collaboration that spanned their entire careers. This study examines their relationship through newly recovered letters and unpublished manuscript material, revealing how two of the most important second-generation Romantic authors engaged in a creative dialogue that informed their most celebrated works, including The Story of Rimini and Don Juan.
