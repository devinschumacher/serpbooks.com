This box set follows three separate missions that test the limits of what heroes can do in a universe where the rules are written on the backs of corporate contracts and the fate of entire worlds hangs in the balance. From Operation Phoenix, where an investigator must choose between duty and revealing his darkest secrets to the woman he loves, to Operation Cobalt, where a pilot falls unexpectedly in love with a missing doctor on a high-stakes search for the truth, and finally to Operation Fury, where a man breaks the law to free a dangerous secret-keeper, only to find himself drawn into a deadly game of shadows and secrets. These stories blend military precision with raw emotion, creating a saga of heroes who must decide what they're willing to lose in a universe where nothing - and no one - is quite what they seem.

Dr. Jody Clark thought starting over at Haven colony would be the adventure of a lifetime. The last thing she expected was to find herself between two sexy alien healers who can't seem to keep their hands off her. Tariq and Sulat are Vardarian anrik, blood-bound brothers who've lost everything - including the mate they were destined to share. As Jody helps them rebuild their lives, she discovers there's more to healing than fixing what's broken. In a colony under threat from hidden dangers and ancient traditions, these three unlikely allies must learn to trust each other - or risk losing the chance at happiness they've all been searching for. "Her Alien Healers" by Susan Hayes is a compelling story about healing old wounds and daring to start anew in a place that feels both like home and a wild frontier.
